"APPROACHES TO GRADUATE ATTRIBUTES AND CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT PROCESSES IN FACULTIES OF ENGINEERING ACROSS CANADA: A NARRATIVE REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE","A.M. Parker; E.  Watson; M.  Ivey; J. P.  Carey","The CEAB accreditation requirement of graduate attributes and continual improvement processes (GACIP) has been a pervasive topic in the annual CEEA conference proceedings since 2010. The proceedings are a rich primary source of work being done in Canadian tertiary institutions. This narrative review of the literature consolidates and discusses the relevant CEEA papers for 2010-2017 in a manner that is useful to leadership and decision-makers at accredited faculties of Engineering nationwide.
Four guiding research questions were asked of this literature: (1) What general frameworks are being implemented as accredited faculties of Engineering across Canada approach GACIP?; (2) What are the specific activities and methods of one or more of the GACIP steps?; (3) What are the roles and responsibilities of people involved?; and (4) What perspectives are taken in response to the CEAB accreditation criteria, including concerns, issues, and benefits? A qualitative content analysis was conducted on 106 papers meeting selection criteria. Emergent topics were used to form the discussion.

"LEARNING ELECTRONICS THROUGH STORYTELLING","Libby  Osgood; Nadja  Bressan","STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) initiatives have expanded to include ‘art’ withthe moniker: STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math). This acknowledges the importance of creativity in the technical fields and poses the question: How do we incorporate art into the engineering classroom? This paper presents one attempt to incorporate the artof storytelling in a first-year engineering design course in January 2021. It was found that compared with students who received a traditional lecture to learn basic electronicconcepts, the students who used an illustrated storybook to learn the same concepts took significantly less time to replicate a sample circuit (p &lt; .001), and performed better in a post-activity assessment (p &gt; .05). These results indicate that the use of storytelling can be an effective wayto transmit technical content in an engineering classroom, and further studies should be pursued."
"CHARACTERIZING THE ENGINEERING EDUCATION GRADUATE STUDENT EXPERIENCE IN CANADA: RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT & REFLECTIONS","Jillian Seniuk Ciceka; Liz Kuleyb; Patricia Sheridan; Robyn Mae Paul","Four Canadian Engineering Education students from the Universities of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Toronto and Calgary have conceptualized conducting a national study to characterize the identities of graduate students studying Engineering Education in Canada. We developed the Canadian Engineering Education Student Identity Study (CEESIS). This is a mixed methods cross-case comparison research study designed to explore how Canadian Engineering Education graduate students’ identities are  formed through the intersection of our intellectual, institutional and  networking academic experiences nested within our personal lives.In this paper, we detail the realization, purpose, benefits, theoretical design and methodology of this study. The development of our theoretical framework and survey through the use of McAlpine’s identity-trajectory construct is discussed. We conclude with individual personal reflections on how this research process has shaped our own growth as Engineering Education graduate students and how participation in this research group has influenced our understanding and identity of being Engineering Education graduate students and emerging Engineering Education  researchers in Canada"
"A SNAPSHOT METHODOLOGICAL REVIEW OF JOURNAL ARTICLES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION RESEARCH","Qin  Liu","Explicit discussion of methodology is important to better understand how knowledge claims are made in a field. In light of a methodological taxonomy, this exploratory review paper examined the research topics and methodologies that were used in a sample of 142 articles published in 2018 by four major engineering education journals. The analysis reveals that engineering education research exhibits varied profiles in different engineering education journals. It also identifies several patterns and trends in the current state of engineering education research. The findings will not only provide novice engineering education researchers with a snapshot, yet an illustrating view, of the emerging field of EER but also offer a starting point to examine critical questions in the field of EER, such as quality and rigor.

"THE IMPACT OF INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGES AND PERSPECTIVES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION: ONE STUDENT’S STORY","George  Kilada; Victoria  Thomsen; Jillian  Seniuk Cicek; Afua  Adobe Mante; Randy  Herrmann","A qualitative narrative study was designed to examine the impact on students’ learning when an Elder came to speak to students in a Technology, Society and the Future course in the Price Faculty of Engineering at the University of Manitoba. This study accounts for one student’s story as heard through an open-ended narrative interview facilitated by a team of researchers, and restoried into a problem-solution narrative structure. The preliminary findings highlight the impact of the Elder’s teachings on the student, the importance of Indigenous People’s Knowledges and perspectives in engineering education, and the importance of making space for students to reflect on these learnings."
"Should they learn to know it first? On the role of critical interpretation and critique in introductory engineering design education","Edmund Nolan; Benjamin Kinsella; Lydia Wilkinson; Jay Pooley","Engineering education at the university level typically includes a first-year course on engineering design. While critical interpretation skills are involved in teaching the design process, those skills themselves are not a main focus, or considered prerequisite to design learning. Other creative fields—including architecture, drama and creative writing—expect students to have experience interpreting and critiquing their art form before they begin creating at a university level. Based on experience teaching first year engineering design, our students are far less likely to have that experience. We investigate the impact of that gap, establish a basis for further research and gain a more coherent picture of how engineering design education compares to other creative fields, in particular as regards the role of critical interpretation and the related practice of critique."
"A Review of Trends in Engineering Education Research from an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Perspective","Branna MacDougall; Demewoz Menna; Bronwyn Chorlton","Equity, diversity, and inclusivity (EDI) have been a topic of high interest in recent years as engineering trends towards becoming a diverse and inclusive profession for all. The purpose of this research is to understand trends in EDI-related engineering education research in Canada over the past ten years and to allow for a reflection of previously identified needs that have yet to see change. This study considers engineering education papers based in Canada published from 2013 through 2022. Several unique subsets of EDI have been consistent areas of interest throughout the past 10 years; gender has been and remains one of the top researched EDI topics, with race and ethnicity receiving approximately consistent research attention throughout, albeit to a lesser extent than gender. Certain areas of diversity have seen consistently little research attention throughout the years, such as the need to consider accessibility in engineering education and practice."
"A STORY TELLING APPROACH FOR TEACHING ENGINEERING COURSES: A MINI-CASE METHOD","Milad Shakeri Bonab; Mohammadamin Ghasemzadeh; Roozbeh Alishahian; Alidad Amirfazli","Engineering courses should connect theory and practice, promote critical thinking, and engage students. Traditional teaching methods are becoming less appealing, and new strategies such as Problem-Based Learning and Flipped Classrooms have not been widely adopted. Case studies have been tried before, but open-ended ones require a complete overhaul of teaching methods and can end up feeling like projects rather than classroom tools. The mini-case approach is introduced as an in-class teaching tool to better engage students and show them the real-world implications of what they are learning. The mini-case structure includes a story, objective statement, student ideation, synthesis of students' ideas, simplification and working model, solution, conclusion, and discussion. The story is crucial to generating interest and retaining attention. The objective statement summarizes the case study's story, goals, and constraints in a single sentence. Students ideate about how to approach the problem, and their ideas are synthesized into a model that is simplified to fit the class's constraints. The solution is either analytical or numeric, and the case study objective statement is revisited to examine whether the requirements and criteria have been met. Reflection on the process and what the results mean is encouraged. The Mini Applied Case Studies (MACS) framework was developed as a structured approach to problem-solving in engineering courses. In the context of a Dynamics class, the framework was applied to the crank-slider mechanism, a challenging topic that students often struggle to understand. The MACS method successfully engaged students and developed their problem-solving skills. Feedback indicated that students found the method effective and interactive. Further research is needed to determine the full potential of the MACS method in other academic contexts."
"Research Through Design – A research paradigm that integrates engineering designers and engineering education researchers","Jason Foster; Alison Nandram","Engineering education as currently practiced is effectively undertaking traditional educational research in an engineering context. While valuable for understanding and promoting change in engineering education, this approach calls into question why engineering education should be redefined as a unique research discipline. This research paper explores an emerging research paradigm – ""Research Through Design"" (RTD) – and suggests how it can be integrated into engineering education research. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical understanding of the history, objectives, and methods of RTD, and to assess its potential applicability both to advance engineering education research and to integrate the engineering education research community"
"Reflections on my engineering student experience and career path: Exploring my positionality and the impact to my research","D'Andre Wilson-Ihejirika","Critical reflection and positionality has become more common in engineering education research. I am a PhD student pursuing research to explore the influence of the undergraduate experience on career pathways for engineering graduates. The purpose of this critical reflection is to determine which aspects of my undergraduate experience and career path might have been influential for me and how this impacts my research process. This reflection included narratives describing pivotal moments or experiences in my undergraduate degree and career path, theming them using an inductive approach. The majority of experiences deemed to be pivotal or influential to my career were related to my sense of belonging and my involvement in student clubs. These experiences have affected my research process through my research topic, methodology and how I relate to my research participants. This allows me to be cognizant of my biases as I continue my PhD research."
"“Critical Space”: An emerging community to engage in critical thinking and de/anti-colonial praxis","Dimpho Radebe; Jasmine McDermott; Paula Alves; Qurat Dar; Renato Rodrigues; Robyn Paul","We are six engineers and engineering researchers from four institutions across Turtle Island , in Canada. We all share similar values and perspectives regarding the colonial, patriarchal, and capitalist (exploitative) nature of traditional engineering education and practices. Upon coming together, we noted shared feelings of isolation in our respective institutions. We felt stifled by the dominant ‘culture of disengagement’ that perpetuates depoliticization, the myth of meritocracy, and the socio/technical dualism in engineering. Consequently, we decided to create a book club (learning community) to engage with critical and decolonial literature in a collaborative manner. More specifically, we intended to form critical perspectives of engineering through non-dominant paradigms. In this paper, we reflect on our engagement in a critical literature book club as a space for learning and community support in engineering education."
"ONE SETTLER STUDENT’S STORY ON INCORPORATING INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGES IN ENGINEERING CURRICULA","Victoria  Thomsen; Jill  Seniuk Cicek; Afua  Mante; Shawn  Bailey; Farhoud  Delijani","The University of Manitoba Price Faculty of Engineering is actively working on initiatives to increaseIndigenous representation and ideology in engineering education. The initiatives aim to create ethical and equitable space for Indigenous Peoples, so their knowledges and perspectives are visible and valued in the Price Faculty of Engineering community. An Elder-in- Resident presented to an engineering ethics class the realities Indigenous communities face and how to work with Indigenous Peoples at the intersection of engineering projects such as oil and gas, hydroelectricity, andcommunity infrastructure. This study uses the threedimensional space narrative methodology and boundarycrossing theory to realize the impact on students’ learning.&nbsp; The student’s perspective negotiated and represented in this study acts as an artifact of boundary crossing and provides insight into the exchange of cross-cultural knowledge. Findings reveal a distinction between relationship and knowledge, where knowledge exchange is dependent on the relationship between people. Key factors contributing to a relationship include identifying each other’s historical backgrounds; situational contexts, and values, which require active listening; genuine curiosity; empathy; and time. The research presented in this paper is part of a more extensive case study exploring the impact onstudents’ learning when integrating Indigenous knowledges and perspectives into engineering education and is approved by the University of Manitoba’s Research Ethics Board."
"Rethinking the Engineering Design Process: Advantages of Incorporating Indigenous Knowledges, Perspectives, and Methodologies","Reed  Forrest; Jillian  Seniuk Cicek","A recent increase in interest in the inclusion of Indigenous Ways of Knowing in engineering education has led to the discussion on how to bridge the worldviews of Indigenous Peoples and modern engineers. A literature review was performed to identify issues in current engineering practice, explore the value of perspective in the process of problem solving, distinguish the differences between engineering and Indigenous worldviews, analyze how these worldviews are compatible and incompatible, and formulate a general approach and value system for engineers going forward. Findings show that there is a need to revise how engineers approach problems, and that the consideration of alternative perspectives can provide new avenues for solving problems. There were indications of potential for symbiosis between Indigenous cultures and engineering, as the inclusion of Indigenous knowledges in engineering and engineering education would not only preserve Indigenous cultures, but alsoimprove the quality of engineering design solutions."
"WHO YOU ARE AND HOW YOU WORK: EMBEDDING POSITIONALITY IN ENGINEERING DESIGN ","Noosheen Walji; Patricia K. Sheridan; Penny  Kinnear; Robert  Irish; Jason Foster","As the Engineering profession increasingly explores the complex relationships between technology and society, the responsibility of engineers is evolving to include considering the socio-technical complexities in which their technology will be embedded [1]. This evolution has led to interest in teaching empathy and reflexivity in undergraduate engineering education, in part to prepare student engineers for effective community engagement in their engineering practice [2] [3].&nbsp; This practice paper discusses considerations, approaches, and theories that informed our design practice as we incorporated positionality into our course. Positionality was introduced as a foundational design tool to approximately 300 students in a first-year design course at a large, public, research-intensive university. In this work we discuss the integration of positionality as a framework to facilitate self-awareness, intentionality, leadership, reflexivity, and empathy in individual and team engineering design activities."
"Towards Defining Threshold Concepts for Decolonizing Engineering","Janel Wyllie-Runner; Jillian Seniuk Cicek; Kari Zacharias","The Calls to Action published by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada express a need for post-secondary institutions to integrate Indigenous knowledge and teaching methods into the classroom. In response, engineering programs across Canada have started to explore what decolonization and Indigenization might look like in the context of engineering education. Moodie [20] has theorized five threshold concepts that may be useful for understanding learning in the context of Indigenous Studies for non-Indigenous students and faculty. This paper presents an analysis of threshold concepts for student learning around decolonizing engineering, using secondary accounts of two engineering students’ experiences with Indigenous Knowledges and worldviews in an engineering classroom. We explore how incorporating Indigenous Knowledges in engineering education may require students to cross ontological and epistemological thresholds."
"Unveiling the Hidden Synergy Between Extra-Curriculars and Engineering Education within the Framework of CEAB Graduate Attributes: A Personal Reflection","Prarthona Paul; Chirag Variawa","Navigating undergraduate engineering education can be a challenging process, with students facing a multitude of expectations and pathways towards graduation. While core elements like courses are central, the significance of ""extra-curricular"" opportunities in enriching the learning experience is often undervalued. This paper challenges the notion of these activities as ""extra"" by examining their role in developing skills aligned with the 12 Canadian Graduate Attributes. Through an analysis of literature and a case study of a first-in-the-family female engineering student, this paper explores the skills that engineering students can acquire through extra-curricular involvement through a personal reflection. Furthermore, it investigates the relationship between these skills and the Canadian Engineering Graduate Attributes, aiming to redefine the connection between curricular and extra-curricular activities. Preliminary findings suggest a link between extra-curricular engagement and students' personal and academic development, yet there is a gap in understanding how these activities align with the Canadian Engineering Graduate Attributes. This study aims to bridge this gap, continuing the conversation on the importance of extra-curricular activities in engineering education. By redefining the role of extra-curricular activities, this research seeks to promote their integration into the curriculum, encouraging broader student participation and fostering learning beyond the classroom."
"GAMIFICATION IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION IN CANADA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE","Renato Alan   Bezerra Rodrigues","In order to tackle issues related to student engagement and motivation, some instructors have used games design elements as pedagogical methods in their classroom. Research on the use of gamified pedagogies in engineering education has grown in the last 15 years. However, past literature reviews found almost no papers documenting the use of gamification in Canada. Therefore, this paper will report the results of a systematic literature review specifically focused on the use of game-based learning and gamification strategies in engineering education in Canada. Results showed that 15 papers documented the pedagogical use of games or gamification in the Canadian undergraduate engineering education context. Most papers reported positive outcomes regarding student attitude, motivation and engagement; however, more research is needed on the efficacy of gamified pedagogies in delivering learning outcomes."
"Some Epistemological Groundwork for a Qualitative Analysis of a Communication Community of Practice","Debora Rolfes; Corey Owen","This paper describes a study that attempts to assess learning transfer in an engineering communication programme through a qualitative study using narrative and rhetorical theory, both of which are humanistic theories that have only recently been considered in such assessment. The communicationprogramme attempts to foster a communication community of practice among its students, and thereby ensure that the skills they cultivate in the classroom can be applied in the various contexts provided by the engineering profession. The researchers use narrative and rhetorical theory to analyze transcripts of in-depth interviews, in order to detect evidence of what EtienneWenger would regard as an identity of participation."
"ACADEMIC IMPACT AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF DESIGN TEACHING ASSISTANTS IN UNDERGRADUATE COURSES","Flavio Firmani; Michael McWilliam; Peter Wild","This paper presents the impact that theDesign Engineering and Design (DE&amp;I) program offeredin 2013 has had in the Faculty of Engineering at theUniversity of Victoria. Through this program a pool ofnineteen graduate students were trained as DesignTeaching Assistants (DTAs). The purpose of this programis to train DTAs in engineering design principles andpedagogical skills for mentoring students working ondesign projects. During the year DTAs continued theirtraining by attending seminars presented by guestspeakers. To date, eight DTAs have been appointed toeither assist as qualified Teaching Assistant in alreadyestablished engineering design courses (two DTAs), or todevelop new design projects in courses that are primarilyengineering science (six DTAs). The latter was supportedby the course instructor and the coordinators of thisprogram. The paper describes the development andmanagement of these design projects, their impact onundergraduate students, and the personal experiencegained by the DTAs. Also, the paper presents a review ofthe 2013 DE&amp;I program including a new strategy for theupcoming 2014 DE&amp;I workshops that will focus more onthe development and execution of design projects of theDTAs."
"What about sustainability? Adding the “S” to leadership and management competency development in the engineering curriculum","Nadine Ibrahim; Marnie V. Jamieson; John R. Donald","To provide a framework for engineering educators to map leadership and management skills development in the curriculum, the authors previously created a Leadership-Management Development Model (LMDM). In this paper we look to extend the model to include sustainability by using an “environmental limits approach”, creating a &nbsp;Leadership-Management -Sustainability Development Model (LMSDM). Adding the sustainability dimension provides a contextual purpose for leadership and management development as it relates to creating and stewarding sustainable socio-technical engineering solutions. This can set a common language and a harmonized framework in the context of skills development and application in engineering practice to complex socio-technical problems. Ultimately the model will allow programs and instructors to map and situate the development of leadership, management and sustainability concepts in their programs in an integrated manner., and to examine learning outcomes relevant to the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) graduate attributes (GA). Curricular examples are provided to give insight into application of the LMSDM in engineering courses and programs. Future work will include mapping the developed LMSDM to engineering curriculum at multiple institutions."
"EXPANDING ENGINEERING DESIGN WITH MINI PROJECTS – THEORY OF MECHANISMS A PILOT COURSE","Flavio Firmani; Sohad Kadhum; Peter Wild","In order to expand the instruction ofengineering design in courses that are predominantlyengineering science, the Chair in Design Engineering ofthe University of Victoria has launched a program tointroduce design mini-projects. The development andmanagement of these projects is conducted by the courseinstructor in collaboration with a Design TeachingAssistant. The first design mini-project has beendeveloped for Theory of Mechanisms, a third-year corecoursein Mechanical Engineering. The course isprimarily theoretical and includes four laboratoryprojects that are based on deterministic problems. Inorder to establish an appropriate project, a list oflearning objectives that complements the theoreticalcontent of the course and exposes students to anengineering design problem has been identified. Theproject consists in designing and building an automatonfor young children – a mechanical toy operated by a handcrank. Overall the project was successful, studentsrapidly embraced it, the submitted prototypes generallymet or exceeded our expectations, and the learningobjectives were achieved."
"The Innovation Problem Finder Dartboard: Embedding Critical Design in the Engineering Workflow","Alexi Orchard","This paper introduces the “Innovation Problem Finder Dartboard"" (IPFD), a generative critical design-inspired pedagogical tool for ideating on the potential uses, misuses, and alternative contexts of a given technology. In a first year Engineering Communication course, students used the IPFD, accompanied by a brief worksheet they completed in groups, during the problem definition stage of their term project. The aim of employing the IPFD activity in this context is twofold: students will 1) generate ideas about how equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) and social and environmental justice factor into an engineering design problem and 2) think critically about existing and potential engineering contexts, cultures, and practices."
"LEARNING FROM ECOFEMINISM: DECONSTRUCTING THE DUALISTIC ‘SOFT’ VS. ‘HARD’ NATURE OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION ","Robyn  Paul; Laleh  Behjat; Marjan  Eggermont; Robert  Brennan","There has been little progress in increasing the diversity of engineering over the past three and a half decades. Much of the diversity work in engineering has an implicit liberal feminism and fails to deconstruct the hierarchical social categories and the underlying ideals of engineering culture. There is a growing need to critically look at the embedded culture of engineering and how this presents a barrier to diversity. This paper provides a critical review of key ecofeminist literature and how engineering education can learn from ecofeminist approaches. The ecofeminist framework aims to breakdown dualisms that artificially separate humans and nature, and rather emphasizes the essential interdependence of all organisms. The aim of this work is to better understand how ecofeminism could be used as a framework to change the culture of engineering education to create a more inclusive environment and foster a greater holistic skillset in our students."
"LEADERSHIP TRANSCENDING BORDERS: BUILDING BRIDGES TO INTEGRATE TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE ","William  Schell; Bryce Hughes; John Donald; Tom Goldfinch; Anthony  Kadi; Emily Moore; Doug Reeve; Cindy  Rottmann; Patricia  Sheridan","Engineering knowledge is characterized by an artificial “border” that distinguishes technical expertise from the professional skills needed to solve society’s most pressing problems. Scholars of engineering leadership argue that students who are provided opportunities to blur that distinction and integrate their technical and professional training are better prepared for interdisciplinary and transnational engineering work. This “Lightning Talk” session brings together engineering leadership researchers from universities in Australia, Canada, and the United States to explore an array of approaches to understanding and developing engineering leadership. Best practices are presented followed by a panel discussion of the implications for internationalizing work on engineering leadership."
"Developing a Catalogue of Environmental Sustainability Tools to Inform Biomedical Engineering Design Education","Melissa Yu; Jenna Usprech; Negar Harandi; Robyn Newell; Calvin Kuo","Despite the negative impact that the environmental crisis can have on human health, the healthcare sector is a significant contributor of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, biomedical engineering design has primarily focused on human safety, with limited attention to environmental sustainability. To address this, we conducted a review of tools to support environmental sustainability analysis and proposed how we think they can support biomedical engineering design education. We conducted a literature search to identify available tools and categorized them according to the biomedical engineering design process taught at the University of British Columbia. We found that there was a lack of tools to support sustainability at early design stages, limiting student’s ability to take a proactive approach to sustainable design. Moving forward, we plan to use this review as a reference tool to guide curriculum improvements for biomedical engineering design courses to include a greater focus on environmental sustainability."
"TRAINING VERSATILE ENGINEERS: A HISTORICAL AND PRESENT PERSPECTIVE ON THE PLACE OF THE HUMANITES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES IN THE CANADIAN ENGINEERING CONTEXT","John Donald; Sofie Lachapelle; Jacqueline McIsaac; Tara Abraham; Ryan Clemmer; Karen Gordon; Stuart McCook; Richard G. Zytner","The importance of training well-rounded engineers has been discussed by engineering educators since the end of the Second World War. For decades now, the humanities and social sciences have been used to encourage engineering students to develop social competency, ethical awareness, and the ability to express themselves with ease, both orally and in writing. In Canada, the humanities and social sciences are featured prominently in the curriculum as part of complementary studies, which comprises both required and elective courses. How do students understand their experience with the humanities and social sciences during their degree? Do they see the usefulness of the skills and content learned in these fields for the job market? This study constitutes a first step in a larger project exploring these questions. Here we first present an overview of the historical and present debates on the place that humanities and social sciences have in the engineering curriculum. We then report on the feedback obtained from focus groups of graduating students asked about their experience and attitudes relative to “soft skills” graduate attributes and complementary studies. We conclude that the new Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board graduate attribute framework provides an opportunity to assess the role of the humanities and social sciences in the engineering curriculum and suggest possible ways to measurably enhance student experience and learning of non-technical or “soft” skills."
"ENHANCING ENGINEERING EDUCATION WITH INDIGENOUS CULTURES, PEDAGOGIES, KNOWLEDGES, AND PERSPECTIVES: A SERIES OF FACULTY WORKSHOPS  ","Jillian  Seniuk Cicek; Afua  Mante; Marcia  Friesen; Randy  Herrmann","In the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Manitoba, we are committed to creating belonging for Indigenous and non-Indigenous students and faculty by fostering shared values and developing a shared approach to engineering education. In the spirit of this commitment, a team of four from the Faculty of Engineering has been funded to design a series of seven engineering specific faculty workshops to help build good relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous engineering students, faculty, and staff. Our goal is to enrich engineering education by learning how engineering is relevant to Indigenous Peoples from Indigenous perspectives, with the ultimate objective to integrate Indigenous values, knowledges, perspectives, and design principles into engineering teaching and learning in relevant, genuine, and good ways. This Engineering Education Practice Paper presents the design of the seven workshops, and briefly introduces the conceptual framework that guides the team’s approach.

"The Nature of a Problem, Problem Diagnosis, and Engineering Design ","Scott A.C.   Flemming; Clifton R.  Johnston ","This work has been motivated by the authors’ past explorations into engineering culture and engineering design which have both exposed the importance of and lack of problem definition in the engineering design process.&nbsp; This paper builds on those previous works and reviews literature from the fields of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence as well as medical science.&nbsp; Studies in cognitive science have identified that experts perform much better in the complex task of problem identification than novices and that scheme-based instruction can greatly ameliorate novice diagnostic performance in an ill-defined complex domain such as medical science. The authors argue that these results will transfer to the analogous ill-defined and complex domain that is engineering design.&nbsp; In this case, the conclusion of this work is for engineering educators to develop schemes (templates) to describe in broad strokes the “universe of problems” in their particular field to aid their students in diagnosing problems for the purposes of engineering design."
"DEVELOPING ETHICAL ENGINEERS WITH EMPATHY","Jennifer  Howcroft; Kate  Mercer; Jennifer  Boger","Empathy-based skill development can help engineering students work towards professional expectations regarding ethical duties. However, there is a lack of explicit, holistic pedagogical approaches toempathy education in engineering. In BME161, a first-year biomedical engineering design course, students received explicit and implicit instruction focused on empathy and ethics. Students were also expected to use empathy-based tools and incorporate stakeholder perspectives in their design process in meaningful and explainable ways. While this approach was successful in incorporating empathybased education into a design course, a more holistic approach is needed throughout the program. Therefore, a high-level framework is presented based on four pillars of empathy development: communication, collaboration, decision-making, and values with a goal of achieving an interpersonal, user-centered, empathic culture of design in engineering students. Future work will focus on developing a more detailed and actionable framework."
"Decolonizing and Indigenizing Engineering: The Design & Implementation of a New Course","Jillian Seniuk Cicek; Randy Herrmann; Reed Forrest; Kyle Monkman","This practice paper introduces a new course designed by one Indigenous and one non-Indigenous engineering educator at the University of Manitoba to decolonize and Indigenize engineering. Working with an Indigenous teaching assistant, and supported by a doctoral student auditing the course, we facilitated a small group of Indigenous and non-Indigenous engineering students to think critically about making place and space for Indigenous Peoples and worldviews in engineering. Here, we share the course design, our reflections on the course, and our plans going forward. Our initiative is one answer the Calls to Action by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of Canada to learn the truth about Canada as colonizer and use education as a tool for reconciliation. In doing so, we aim to provide engineering students with knowledges and perspectives for working successfully with First Nations, Métis and Inuit Peoples and communities in engineering practice in Manitoba, and in Canada."
"Simple And Effective Teaching Strategies for Increasing Graduate Attributes Competency Levels","Sabrina Turrin; Katrina Poulin; Amanda Saxe; Roni Khazaka; Marwan Kanaan","Instructors often assume that implementing new teaching strategies will require a significant amount of time and preparation, however, that is not always the case. In fact, numerous near-effortless teaching strategies were proven to be effective in several disciplines in higher education. This paper surveys leading educational journals and identifies such strategies which also have the potential of being successful in an engineering classroom. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these strategies for developing graduate attributes is explored."
"“THERMODYNAMICS IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT!” [7] AN EXPLORATORY STUDY ON INCORPORATING ACTIVE LEARNING INTO A FIRST YEAR THERMODYNAMICS COURSE","Jillian Seniuk Cicek; Douglas Ruth; Sandra Ingram","Student engagement is deemed as one of the fundamental components of consequential learning. Essentially, contextualizing information in authentic events and situations and designing active learning experiences to orchestrate opportunities for students to construct their own knowledge are ways to engage students in their own learning process. This paper reports on a Professor’s efforts to turn a traditional, lecture- based first year Thermodynamics course into an active learning arena. The study uses a qualitative approach to data collection and analysis, with data amassed through participant observations and open-ended interviews with the Professor. A number of categories and themes have already emerged. This paper outlines the category, Instructional Strategies, and discusses how they were modified and/or amplified to incorporate active learning in an attempt to further engage students."
"First-Year Project-Based Engineering Design Courses in Canadian Institutions","Shelir Ebrahimi; Cameron Farrow; John R. Donald; Marnie Jamison","First-year engineering design courses are fundamental component to most engineering programs, and they provide the backbone for the introduction of engineering students to engineering practice and profession. First-year engineering design courses are also essential to begin the development of an engineering mindset. The purpose of this study is to complete a comparative examination of first-year engineering design courses across Canada. The work was inspired by an interactive workshop delivered at CEEA-ACEG 2022. The workshop was based on a comparative examination of the curriculum and delivery of three first-year design courses at different engineering institutions, including number of students and credits, project types, content integration, resources, and logistics. Informed by the discussion in the workshop, this study expands on the work by surveying instructors of first-year engineering design courses. The preliminary results are presented from a subset of the data collected and demonstrate similarities and differences among the different programs. These results provide a foundation for meaningful analysis and discussion of educational practice in first-year engineering design courses."
"Engineering Inclusivity by Design: Co-Designing an Inclusive Innovation Workshop","Fatima Nazir; Shayna Earle; Andrea Hemmerich","In North American universities, engineering faculties often exhibit unequal representation, with inclusivity in the curriculum hindered by aspects like elitism and technical social dualism. This project aimed to foster a more inclusive engineering culture by co-designing a workshop with students at McMaster University to appreciate diverse identities and incorporate equity principles into their work. The ""Inclusive Innovation Design Challenge"" workshop, attended by 55 students, introduced concepts of self-identity and positionality, followed by a human-centred design sprint based on equity-based co-design principles. Participants developed personas and brainstormed solutions to design challenges, enhancing awareness of the value of diverse perspectives. The outcome was overwhelmingly positive; feedback from a post-workshop survey indicated a shift in participants' perceptions towards their identities and the inclusion of diverse perspectives in design. Ongoing research will evaluate the workshop's impact on integrating these insights into coursework and enhancing the sense of belonging in engineering programs."
"Development of a scalable, immersive, multiplayer game for teaching engineering courses","Tahzinul Islam; Moshi Wei; Alidad Amirfazli","A scalable and immersive game was developed to serve as a monthly concept review game for theory-heavy engineering courses (such as fluid dynamics or heat transfer). It was designed such that in-game items and content may be dynamically replaced easily with an Excel data table, without the need for further programming. It is expected that course instructors may use such a tool by simply updating an Excel data table to rapidly tailor the game for any course. Even room/zone designs may be parametrized using a data table. Given the automation level of such a tool, its scalability and adaptability, the results of this work demonstrate the an innovative tool for educators to use for rapid construction of fun learning environments for engineering students in fun, game worlds. Future multiplayer game development can aid with collaborative learning to an even higher degree."
"Experiential Learning vs Systematic Prescriptions in Engineering Design: A Crossroads for Education","G. R. Gressfc; S. Li; R. W. Brennan","The systematic, non-experiential prescriptions of classical design methodology continue to have a strong presence in large segments of design research and education while another segment sees domain experience and consequent intuition and creativity as being key to successful design. In this paper the two approaches are outlined and the empirical research literature in human behaviour is employed to discern discrepancies and potential weaknesses. Results show that gaining experience in a domain intrinsically changes how one designs, which the classical methodology does not account for. For example, only designers with tactile and visual domain experience can abstract functions per the dictates of the classical (non-experiential) methodology, which means that they cannot have used the methodology to learn basic design in the first place – or did so only with great difficulty. This and other conflicts pose problems for the education of engineering design students, and to fathom their extent this paper surveys engineering design textbooks offered in Canada and the U. S.; all of the books are found to embrace the classical methodology. If they are to remain involved in preparing students for entry into industry then some aspects of their contained classical methodology must be supplanted by experiential approaches to design educatio"
"Teaching Engineering Conferences","Thomas Zielke; Matthias Neef; Claudia Fussenecker","Abstract – This article is on a university course called Engineering Conferences. It has been developed by the authors and installed as a mandatory part of the curriculum in three master’s degree programs for engineering students. The participants of the course are postgraduates with different nationalities, mostly German, and different technical backgrounds. They study Mechanical Engineering, Simulation and Experimental Technology, or International Business Engineering.&nbsp; The basic idea of the course concept goes far beyond simply teaching the standards of academic writing and skills for using scientific publications. By using a learnercentered approach, the students get engaged in typical activities around an active attendance of a real conference. Students learn to locate the field of their bachelor thesis or project report in the world of research communities, scientific journals and engineering conferences. They learn about conferences matching their bachelor/project topic. They write a paper complying with common academic standards, submit it to a mock-up conference, and review submissions of their fellow students. Students also produce a poster and have to defend it in a poster session held publicly on the campus. Engineering Conferences is a course on scientific communication and presentation that also aims at the development of other skills and competences needed in the world of modern engineering.

"Applying the Social Determinants of Health to Understand the Impacts of Engineering on Indigenous Communities","Claire Sagan; Clayton Cook; Harvey Wastasecoot; Randy Herrmann; Jillian Seniuk Cicek","Public and population health have recently received increased attention in society. Specifically, the social determinants of health, which describe 12 social and economic factors have been used as a framework to understand the complexity of health. Engineering has a unique position in society to influence these factors, however, there has been limited appreciation for the opportunities for engineering projects to influence the broader determinants of health and to incorporate these concepts into engineering education, despite the recognition from health and public health professionals of their importance. The purpose of this narrative participatory action research study is to explore the connection between engineering and the social determinants of health in two First Nations communities in [redacted]. Narrative conversations with two researcher-participants from [redacted]and [redacted] were had over three months to listen to the lived experiences of these community members and explore the impact of engineering on health. Their stories demonstrate that engineering has the potential to greatly affect the physical environment, and in turn influence population health. As engineers, it can be difficult to consider the socioeconomic effects of engineering projects on stakeholders due to the at times, indirect cause and effect relationship. This study identifies opportunities for engineers to consider and improve some aspects of population health but leaves us to wrestle with the impact of engineering on complex social elements."
"EMPOWERING ENGINEERING STUDENTS IN ETHICAL RISK MANAGEMENT","Yoann Guntzburger","The purpose of our study is to assess to what extent engineers are empowered by their professional training to engage in ethical risk management. Using the concept of self-efficacy and the results from a questionnaire answered by 200 engineering students, we suggest that the present engineering education fails to induce such empowerment.We therefore propose an innovative method to help in this matter. Carried out through workshops with 34 students, the efficiency of this method has been evaluated using group interviews and questionnaires. Our results suggest that such an approach is efficient, at least in the short run, to motivate students to engage in ethical risk management. Maybe more importantly, it triggers reflectivity on what it means to be an engineer today, a first step in engaging into the ultimate Grand Challenge of self-knowledge."
"A Synthesis of Best Practices for Engineering Skill Self-Efficacy Measures: Towards Improved Evaluation of Computer-Aided Design Education","Elizabeth DaMaren; Alison Olechowski","Self-efficacy is a concept that refers to one’s belief in one’s ability to complete tasks and achieve goals, and literature has shown it is correlated to student retention and success in engineering education settings. Task-specific self-efficacy measures can be used in engineering contexts to evaluate student confidence in specific skills, which educators can use to evaluate learning impacts in their classrooms. This work seeks to support the creation of these tools by presenting a structured literature review consolidating existing work on the creation of skill-specific self-efficacy measures, predominantly within engineering. An example of how instructors might use these learnings is then provided by explaining application of these findings in the context of the creation of a Computer-Aided Design self-efficacy measure. By summarizing key learnings around the development of engineering skill-specific self-efficacy measures, we hope to enable engineering education researchers and educators to conduct more comprehensive evaluation of educational interventions."
"Developing skills for sustainable development through community-focused learning","Mark Castillo; Jeffrey Harris","For engineering students to become leaders in sustainable development, they need to develop the ability to apply empathy in partnership with communities and collaborate across disciplinary boundaries. This is difficult to facilitate in the dominant engineering education paradigm that emphasizes technical ability while social engagement is not stressed as much. We have implemented community-focused experiential education to foster skills for leadership in sustainable development. Experiential education is based on the theory of situated learning, in which students learn through the praxis of authentic environments. Implementing experiential learning in the classroom exposes engineering students to the necessary skills to deal with wicked and complex problems. It creates an environment that gives space for failure and learning then iteration. The implementation of experiential learning in the course reimagines how engineering education can be structured with an emphasis on community engagement and creative problem-solving. In this paper, we introduce an innovative community-based learning (CBL) integrated course with multiple community partners and stakeholders. Students in the course had the opportunity to interact with faculty, industry, and policymakers outside their discipline."
"AN EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING APPROACH FOR DEVELOPING MENTAL MODELS IN ENGINEERING DESIGN EDUCATION","S.  Li; C.  Chua","Mental simulation represents how a person interprets and understands the causal relations associated with the perceived information, and it is considered an important cognitive device to support engineering design activities. Mental models are considered information characterized in a person’s mind to understand the external world. They are important components to support effective mental simulation. This paper begins with a discussion on the experiential learning approach and how it supports learners in developing mental models for design activities. Following that, the paper looks at the four types of mental models: object, making, analysis and project, and illustrates how they capture different aspects and skills of design activities. Finally, the paper proposes an alternative framework, i.e., Spiral Learning Approach, which is an integration of Kolb’s experiential learningcycle and the Imaginative Education (IE) framework. While the Kolb’s cycle informs a pattern to leverage personal experiences to reusable knowledge, the IE’s framework suggests how prior experiences can trigger imagination and advance understandings. A hypothetical design of a snow removal device is used to illustrate the ideas of design-related mental models and the spirallearning approach."
"The development of consciousness and positionality of a recently immigrated international student in engineering education in Canada","Paula Rodrigues Affonso Alves; Kari Zacharias; Jillian Seniuk Cicek","The first engineering education institution in the American continent was the Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification and Design, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil [1]. The institution was funded in 1792 in a military context to build forts to protect the Portuguese colony from the local populations [2]. There are connections between engineering and colonization that persist today, and manifest in different ways. For example, for centuries, Canada has relied on settlers for labor. Many immigrants are professionals and students who develop knowledges, skills, and behaviours needed for jobs to support the Canadian economy. Immigrants may arrive with no historical background, ignorant of the history and current colonial situation in Canada. This can make international student immigrants an instrument for maintaining the colonial structure of the state. In the academia, there is not always time to reflect on the systems that the university assists in reproducing. This paper is a personal reflection on my experiences and my role as an international student in engineering education in the colonial Canadian context of the XXI century."
"USING META-CASES FOR CAPSTONE LEARNING","Stephen L. James; Douglas W. Ruth","The purpose of capstone courses and projects in engineering is to provide a learning experience that effectively and reliably solidifies earlier acquired understandings. It provides a culminating exercise that lies just beyond a student’s existing ability so that learning is furthered while motivation is preserved. Historically, individual engineering projects, practicums, and internships have been heavily used to provide that culminating experience; however, with often disappointing results. This has been particularly the case in attempting to cap off programs in systems engineering where the learning ideal would be to have a student experience a real-world complex multi-disciplinary engineering and program environment. Given the limitation, this paper proposes using a term-long, class-based, repeatable meta-case as the capstone learning venue, particularly in support of systems engineering programs where securing meaningful experiential learning is difficult. Case teaching is a classic approach in law, medicine and business faculties where the need to develop higher cognitive abilities—analyzing, synthesizing and judging—inside high ambiguity and across multi-disciplines is paramount. A meta-case, as opposed to other case types, is characterized by the use of a very complex, multi-factor (engineering) real-world challenge with a long, multi-stage solution scenario. In proposing the use of a capstone meta-case, the paper presents its use in an aerospace systems engineering environment where development timelines are very long, and where the engineering requirements and solutions are many and highly interdependent. It specifically discusses the course design structure and considerations associated with a meta-case based on the development of the Airbus A400 military transport aircraft. The paper is based on a year-long study into the use of the case method for teaching aerospace systems engineering."
"Crafting a Sustainable Engineering Vision Through a Consultation Process","Nathalie Frigon; Judith Cantin; Isabelle Villemure","A wide-ranging consultation process was conducted by Polytechnique Montréal between 2022 and 2023 explores the impact of environmental, technological and societal transformation on the work of engineers and competencies needed, as well as on engineering education. This study highlights a mobilization approach aimed at co-creating a competency profile of the engineer of tomorrow. The methodology includes interviews, internal and external surveys, and a forum bringing together over 250 stakeholders in May 2023. The results provide a better understanding of the global, national and local issues engineers are facing, as well as the competencies required to support the engineer's global development from a sustainable engineering perspective. This vision captures the essence of the engineer's future role, focusing on collaborative efforts to define and implement an updated engineer profile, integrate it into educational pathways, and streamline accreditation processes. This vision aligns with a transformative epistemology and UNESCO's sustainable development goals, offering a blueprint for institutions to mobilize their ecosystem towards common goals."
"Who's Experiencing Weathering? A question of belonging in the engineering profession","Dimpho Radebe; Cindy Rottmann; Andrea Chan; Emily Macdonald-Roach; Emily Moore","Despite persistent efforts to diversify the engineering profession, inequities persist. As part of a larger research project on career paths, the authors conducted a large-scale survey of Canadian engineers with a minimum of 10 years’ experience in professional practice. This line of analysis explores Canadian engineers’ personal sense of belonging in the engineering profession. Results indicate that while 58.1% of survey respondents had a high sense of belonging, racialized women and white women disproportionately rated a lower sense of belonging, despite increases in representation. Further investigation reveals that for racialized women continued low visibility, discrimination, barriers to licensing, and views on what counts as engineering work were some of the reasons for a lower sense of belonging. This mixed-methods research reveals the hidden curriculum – institutional mechanisms – within the profession that contributes to weathering in the profession and highlights the importance of using an intersectional lens when looking at belonging."
"Broken Telephone: The long and Winding Road from Encoding to Decoding in Mixed Methods Research","Cindy Rottmann; Emily Moore; Andrea Chan","It is not uncommon for engineering education researchers who value quantitative analyses to conduct large-scale surveys as validation measures for smaller scale qualitative studies. The purpose of this paper is to examine a limitation of this logic. We adopt Stuart Hall’s encoding/decoding model of communication as a conceptual framework to investigate the mismatch between five engineering career paths we identified through a small, qualitative study and 982 Canadian engineering graduates’ self-identification with those paths on a larger scale national survey. By examining the differences between our encoding of survey items and respondents' self-identified decoding of those items, our paper makes two significant contributions to the engineering education literature, one methodological and one structural. First, our findings raise methodological questions about the widespread use of large-scale surveys as validation measures for small-scale qualitative studies, and second, our critical analysis illustrates internal heterogeneity within senior executive career tracks, enabling us to supplement existing explanations for occupational inequity in the profession."
"Sociotechnical Thinking as a Contextualizing, Transcending, and Cross-Connecting Concept for Engineering Learning","Richard Aleong; Tarek Alkabbani","The complexities of contemporary engineering problems and solutions require deep attention to multiple social and technical aspects pertaining to the situation. Sociotechnical thinking in engineering offers a way to navigate these social and technical complexities that inform the way we inquire and design. While sociotechnical thinking as it relates to engineering education has been explored in various ways, sociotechnical thinking remains an abstract concept with multiple meanings and interpretations. Educators and researchers must think critically about dominant conceptualizations to appreciate how these meanings inform teaching, learning, and practice. In this paper, we describe sociotechnical thinking as a contextualizing, transcending, and cross-connecting concept for engineering learning. First, we present three assumptions that may be limiting current approaches to sociotechnical thinking. Then, we illustrate three different shifts in framing sociotechnical thinking to contribute to an integrated understanding of sociotechnical thinking as it relates to curriculum and pedagogical design. With these shifts, we aim to add meaning and richness that expands pedagogical opportunities for sociotechnical thinking in engineering curriculum, learning and practice."
"Visualizing Engineering: A Practitioner’s Perspective on Engineering Education","Shehryar Saharan; Gaël McGill; Jodie Jenkinson; Michele Oliver; Karen Gordon","Visualizations are integral to the fields of science and engineering, serving as essential tools for both education and professional practice. They encompass a diverse range of modalities, from illustrations to simulations, and play vital roles in facilitating conceptual understanding, scientific discovery, and communication. In engineering education, visual representations are fundamental to problem-solving approaches, requiring learners to navigate complex information through graphical, conceptual, and mathematical components. This paper delves into the role of visualizations as didactic external representations – emphasizing the importance of design choices informed by both empirical evidence and craft-based knowledge. We discuss the gap between visualization research and practice, and showcase visualization stimuli across various scientific subject matter, exemplifying the diverse applications and pedagogical potential of visualizations for engineering education. We also outline key research challenges and opportunities, advocating for partnership between visualization practitioners, researchers and educators to address these challenges."
"Answering Questions of Engineering Identity and Topic Relevance Using the Work of Robert Rosen","Jason Foster; Patricia Sheridan","Some engineering students ask their instructors questions related to the nature of engineering and to the relevance of certain course topics or full courses. Responses to these questions are generally experiential, empirical, and lacking in theoretical rigour. This research paper explores how Robert Rosen’s Modelling Relation and his concept of Anticipatory Systems can be used to understand the nature of engineering in a way that is rigorous, theoretically grounded, and accessible to varied audiences. Abstract engineering and making practices are successfully mapped onto the Modelling Relation, and a concrete example from Civil Engineering is developed. Following from this mapping, engineering is reinterpreted as the actions of an anticipatory system informed by particular predictive models. This mapping and reinterpretation were trialed successfully in an undergraduate engineering design course, and in workshops with participants from a variety of engineering and non-engineering backgrounds. Areas for improvement and exploration include the fractal natural of design, and the challenges associated with complex systems."
"Learning from Learners: Wellness seminars and self-reflections for first-year engineering students to enhance their journey in engineering education","Mandeep Pandey; Robyn Paul; Kim Johnston; Afsah Dawood; Catherine Betancourt-Lee; Kenza Filali; Tausif Tajwar; Brittany Lindsay; Melissa Boyce","First-year engineering can be an overwhelming experience for students, and it is important to have regular check-in points for students as they transition to post-secondary education. Beginning in 2019, the Schulich School of Engineering (SSE) at the University of Calgary implemented mental wellness and engineering attributes modules across the first-year engineering curriculum. These modules focused on students’ overall development to support their success in the diverse world of engineering. In this paper, we give an overview of the program implementation during 2021-2022 and recommendations for effective implementation of such series based on our experiences. We also briefly present a summary of the students’ self-reflections from the first two years of the program.
At the end of each module, we ask students a few open-ended questions to reflect on their experiences based on the materials covered in the module. In addition to these responses from different modules, the final self-reflection, where the students are asked to reflect on their journey as a first-year engineering student, is of immense help in enhancing our understanding of students’ perspectives. Analysis and review of these reflections help mold our strategies for future programming to support student wellbeing and academic and professional development."
"The History of the CEAB Accreditation Criteria and Procedures – Criterion 3.4.5 Complementary Studies","Jason Foster","In Canada, most undergraduate engineering programs are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). Operating since 1965, the Board has developed and accredited against an evolving set of criteria. The accreditation criteria specify that those being accredited may explore alternative interpretations and means of meeting the criteria. However there is little information available to guide such interpretation and design such means. This research summarizes and explores the evolution of the accreditation criteria for those aspects related to “complementary studies” comprising communication, teamwork, ethics, economics, and related topics."
"ANALYSIS OF HOW CAPSTONE TEAMS DEFINE ENGINEERING DESIGN FAILURE","Farrah  Fayyaz","There is a growing trend in engineering education to increase the societal awareness among theengineering graduates, so that the engineering solutions proposed by the engineers are more sustainable. To achieve this, one of the efforts in Concordia University is to ask capstone students to discuss and implement (wherever possible) ethical, legal, social, environmental, and entrepreneurial aspects of their capstone design. Students are given two lectures during the capstone year which provides them with prompts to identify and think beyond their personal biases and perceptions of the society. At the end of the term, each capstone team is asked to define engineering failure. The aim for this is for graduating students to have a well thought of idea of the engineering design failure before they enter the workplace. This article explains the two phases (lectures) of the capstone lectures related to the ethical, legal, societal, environmental, and entrepreneurial aspects of an engineering design. Additionally, the article aims to analyze the definitions of engineering failure submitted by the engineering students at the end of the capstone year to identify keywords and terms that the graduating engineering students attribute to success and failure of an engineering design. The objective of the paper is to open the discussion among engineering educators for incorporating ideas in their courses that can improve engineering students’ understanding of a sustainable design and assess the success of these strategies."
"Bridging the Skillset Gaps in University-Based Incubators","Amin Azad; Emily Moore","Entrepreneurship is a driving force in today's rapidly evolving economy, offering avenues for innovation, economic growth, and societal impact. However, engineering entrepreneurial teams often encounter skill gaps that can impede their ability to navigate the complexities of starting and growing a business effectively. Addressing these skillset gaps is crucial for empowering the next generation of entrepreneurs to thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape. University-based incubators (UBIs) play a significant role in this endeavor, providing a supportive ecosystem for entrepreneurial development within academic institutions. This paper aims to explore the skillset gaps in UBIs affiliated with engineering departments, through a systemic literature review on this topic, complemented by a series of one-to-one interviews with directors, mentors, and investors at various UBIs. The results of this study align with existing literature and highlight a recurring theme regarding the difficulties faced by engineering entrepreneurial teams in areas such as soft skills, as well as challenges related to financial literacy, research proficiency, and sales capabilities. This work aims to delve into specific areas in greater depth and discusses potential pedagogical approaches that could enhance the learnings of these skills with no direct relation to concepts of entrepreneurship."
"Exploration of Skills Needed for Graduate-Level Community Engaged Learning in Engineering","Akinola Ogbeyemi; Wenjun Zhang; Lori Bradford","Community-engaged learning in graduate engineering programs has had growing attention in engineering education research to prepare researchers for supporting communities in solving complex problems. As a practice, community-engaged learning in engineering struggles to achieve equitable outcomes for community partners because students in such programs may lack skills or possess charity or patriarchal mindsets. A charity mindset is characterized by an uncritical desire to help, with Western engineering deemed favourable over community knowledge systems resulting in the design of solutions that try to address symptoms of inequity without meaningful community involvement. With the increase of community-driven and engaged learning in engineering graduate studies, pushed by research agencies and the marketing of large-scaled international grand challenges, the development of engagement skills in graduation education is needed. In this paper, we highlight the specific successes and challenges faced by one graduate student and their supervisors undertaking community-engaged learning. We explore these issues while embedded in a project with three Indigenous communities on improving resilience in an engineering procurement and construction (EPC) process for healthcare facilities in Indigenous communities by incorporating cultural and social factors. We bring forward these successes and challenges to build a conversation around designing curricula for engineering-engaged learning skills for graduate students."
"An Exploration in Facilitating Learning Experiences Towards Inspiring Responsible Software Engineers","Tim Maciag","Johnson poses the question, “what does it mean to be a responsible engineer?” Characteristics could be wide-ranging. Engineers Canada helps by defining graduate attributes (GAs). All GAs are important. However, GA-9 “impact(s) of engineering on society and the environment” is one characteristic that this author proposes is fundamental. The idea of sustainable design and development has seen increasing conversation and engagement in our field in recent years. With initiatives such as the United Nations (UN) “decade of action (DoA),” engineers have the innate responsibility to help deliver the promise of positively transforming our world by 2030 and beyond. Exposing engineering learners to individual and collaborative knowledge-building experiences around the idea of sustainability, and what it means to be sustainable citizens may assist. It could be as we engineers become more knowledgeable in this realm, so too might everyday citizens in their interactions with our creations. Reflecting on Quan-Haase’s idea of technology as society, relating to the idea that society advancements are in large part intertwined with advancements in technology, software engineers may have a significant role to play. This role could include the engineering of community-based computer technologies that engage citizens in knowledge-creating activities towards the betterment and well-being of society. This work explores the following questions.&nbsp;Can inspiration towards becoming a responsible engineer be instilled in engineering learners in academia? Can this be accomplished by facilitating a learning experience that immerses engineering learners in researching and exploring the design and development of computer technologies in support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? Through resulting explorations, might both learners and everyday citizens who interact with the engineered creations be better equipped to participate in the UNs DoA, and beyond? This paper will describe a software systems engineering course at the University of Regina that facilitated a learning experience around these questions. A discussion regarding the structure of the course, its educational content, and results and feedback obtained on the learner experience will be provided. As well, ideas for continued exploration of this work will be discussed."
"Rethinking the ""Impact of Engineering on Society and the Environment""","Kari Zacharias; Stephanie Hladik","The current CEAB attributes, including “the impact of engineering on society and the environment,” represent a welcome shift in engineering education towards acknowledging the sociotechnical nature of engineering practice. The “impact” attribute in particular also demonstrates a need and an opportunity for engineering educators and scholars with interdisciplinary backgrounds to meaningfully contribute to engineering education. In this paper, we offer reflections on and constructive criticism of the “impact” graduate attribute, drawing from our personal experiences as learners and teachers, and from literature in Science and Technology Studies, Engineering Studies, and the Learning Sciences. We develop three related critiques of the current graduate attribute, focusing on its presentation of relationships, directionality, and power. While the inclusion of the “impact” attribute represents a significant step for Canadian engineering towards a more just, sustainable, and decolonial vision for the future of the profession, we argue that the current attribute also reinforces dominant engineering ways of thinking about engineering-society relationships. We conclude the paper by offering a reworked version of the graduate attribute as a provocation and a starting point for discussion."
"Instilling SDG Considerations in Undergraduate Design Capstone","Tate Cao","Engineering education in universities often focuses on theoretical problems, with limited opportunities for students to consider the societal and environmental impact of their designs. Senior engineering design capstones typically involve industry partners providing the problem and context, further restricting students' ability to explore implications. Despite being aware of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), students prioritize personal over professional implications. This study aims to incorporate SDGs into the Engineering Capstone experience by introducing them in a senior student-driven, multidisciplinary Engineering Capstone Design class. Students receive empathy training and use Canadian indicators of UN SDGs to align their designs with positive and negative indicators. They engage with users for feedback on the impact of their choices on SDGs, bridging the ""blind spot"" in their design work and enhancing understanding of the broader context of their designs. Incorporating empathy training and a co-design approach can improve students' understanding of the potential impact of their designs on SDGs."
"GENDERED PATTERNS IN SENIOR ENGINEERS’ LEADERSHIP LEARNING ","Emily  Macdonald-Roach; Cindy Rottmann; Andrea Chan ; Emily Moore","In this paper, we present findings from a secondary gender analysis of interviews conducted for a larger study examining how senior engineers learn to lead over the course of their careers [7, 36-37]. In particular, we analyze a subset of career history interviews conducted for the larger study—four male and four female participants paired by career stage and organizational context—through a gendered lens. In the end, we identified 4 themes that differentiated the experiences of male and female engineers in our sample: 1) Explicit mentions of gender, 2) Mobility, 3) Enacting leadership, and 4) Response to failure. With an understanding that gender can impact experiences implicitly and in ways that are highly contextualized, we explore subtle gender dynamics in engineers’ situated leadership learning opportunities and experiences."
"AN ADAPTED ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS: GUIDING TOUCHSTONES","Chelsea  Dubiel; Jillian  Seniuk Cicek; Roxanne  Greene; Shawn  Bailey; Farhoud  Delijani","The field of engineering needs to develop while healing our relations with the lands, waters, and living systems. Fostering ethical spaces where Indigenous ways of knowing and being and western worldviews can hold space together, and cease to separate the technical from the social, are key to progressing equitably as a society. In the field of engineering within Turtle Island, it is essential that we adapt the engineering design process to reflect this. Following the execution of an Engineering and Architecture transdisciplinary Design Build course at University of Manitoba, and in partnership with the Shoal Lake No. 40 First Nation, it was acknowledged by stakeholders that further analysis of this project could establish lessons learned. This paper speaks to engineering education practice. The objective of this research is to develop recommendations for how the engineering design process can make space for Indigenous ways of knowing and being. Shoal Lake No. 40 community members, one engineering contractor, and four university faculty members were asked their perspectives on the development and implementation of two projects conducted with the community members and on the First Nation lands. Through the co-analysis of these open-ended discussions, recommendations were developed for how the engineering design process can integrate four touchstones external to the design process. The touchstones enable an engineer to perceive the design process and establish core intentions for a project that creates space for Indigenous values and principles and western worldviews."
"Adapting waterfall design to an eight-month capstone course","Franz Newland; Hossam Sadek; James Andrew Smith","York University’s multi-disciplinary capstone design class was established “to include significant elements of design and implementation” in such as manner as to “resemble engineering projects in practice.” The class was restructured in summer 2016 to coincide with the introduction of fourth-year cohorts in both the Electrical and Mechanical programs. The changes were designed to more closely emulate an industry-standard approach. Choosing an industrially-accepted design methodology would provide a good framework for the project design and implementation and would be motivational to the students as they transitioned from university to professional life. In parallel, the course directors used a narrative structure, the Hero’s journey, to help students identify their pathways through capstone and to tell their capstone stories after the experience.We adapted the gating reviews for the Waterfall model often used in large government contracts. At the start of the project, students are provided a governing document (similar to a contract). Gate reviews are held at preliminary and critical design stages, test readiness and post-test review and final delivery. Every deliverable requires team reflection, similar to bidder self-evaluations on government contracts. The project concludes with an open house, similar to a product release, for students to present their projects and processes to stakeholders and the general public.This paper presents the results of the first two years of the newly revised capstone, using the Hero’s Journey metaphor and the waterfall model."
"Engineering educators’ perceptions of the influence of professional/industry experience on their teaching practice","Angela van Barneveld; Johannes Strobel","&nbsp;Abstract –This preliminary study explored engineering educators’ perceptions of the influence of industry experience on their teaching practice. Fifty American engineering educators were interviewed. There appeared to be a distinction in the extent to which influence on practice was reported, based on years of industry experience. Three themes emerged – influence on content and curriculum, influence on instructional strategies and the integration of real world components, and benefits of being a practitioner/educator. Implications and future research are discussed."
"Fostering Inclusive Learning in Engineering through Equity-Based Design Education","Andrea Hemmerich; Negar Deilami; Thuy-Anh Ngo; Sean Park; Robert Fleisig","The integration of equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (EDIA) in engineering education is often overshadowed by traditional engineering ideologies that prioritize technical work and objectivity. Our research aimed to understand how learning equity-based design affected students' perceptions of inclusivity in their learning environment and the quality of their design work. The Design Thinking curriculum was enhanced to integrate EDIA principles and the Liberatory Design framework. We hypothesized that these design courses would positively impact students' equity-based design competencies and sense of belonging in engineering. Data were collected via post-course surveys and reflection assignments. Survey results from six participants indicated positive impacts on students' perceptions of inclusivity and agency for social change. Thematic analysis of reflection assignments revealed a link between self-awareness, inclusive design, and empowerment to challenge societal norms. Despite the study's exploratory nature and small sample size, findings suggested that engaging in equity-based design approaches fostered inclusive learning in engineering education."
"A Holistic Approach to ‘Sustainable Systems Design’ Course Development","Poornima Jayasinghe; Robyn Paul","The new Sustainable Systems Engineering program at the University of Calgary aims to disrupt sustainability education by imbedding a systems approach and regenerative design mindset throughout. This paper provides an overview of the first iteration of the second-year design course, SUSE 300, Introduction to Sustainable Systems. Underlying the course is the idea of transformative learning through systems thinking and design-based approach. Through their design project, personal reflections, and design portfolio, both students and instructors went through transformative learning experiences. In this paper, early reflections from the two co-instructors are provided on creating these ambitious learning experiences, and areas for improvement in the next iteration."
"Opportunities and Obstacles for an Embedded STS Program in Engineering","Alexi Orchard","The “Embedded STS Program” is a model for teaching the ethics of engineering and technology via instructors from a Science and Technology Studies (STS) program housed directly within an Engineering department. Our institution, the University of Waterloo, has an embedded STS-like program under another name, the Centre for Society, Technology, and Values (CSTV). In this paper, we share the results of a qualitative survey completed by 43 students recruited from seven of the CSTV courses offered in 2022. These results provide context as to obstacles and opportunities in the embedded program related to curricular, institutional, and cultural dimensions. We conclude there is a need for resources and leadership to manage the curricular and cultural obstacles that hinder (1) students in applying knowledge on ethics and social impacts across educational and professional contexts and (2) institutions in drawing upon STS expertise for teaching engineering and technology ethics."
"REFLECTING ON THE USE OF DESIGN METHODOLOGY IN ENGINEERING DESIGN EDUCATION","S.  Li; G. Gress; P. Ziadé","In the teaching of engineering design, it may be common to use design methodology (DM), as documented in several textbooks, in the course delivery.&nbsp; However, considerable drawbacks could be observed in our case when DM is taken as the major guidance for a capstone design course. We argue that DM tends to prescribe some context-free methods and procedures, which cannot be easily applied by students to their capstone design projects. At the same time, we observe that students need support to characterize a design problem, integrate technical knowledge in design activities and verify design ideas. These aspects require analytical and critical thinking, where DM may not be particularly helpful for students. In the five-year journey of deemphasizing DM in a capstone design course, we have explored and examined various pedagogical approaches such as online modules, design labs and peer evaluations.&nbsp; Without the teaching of DM, the pedagogical strategy needs to be carefully planned to deliver specific learning in engineering design.

"RATIONALE AND TEACHING OBJECTIVES FOR A CANADIAN ENGINEERING ETHICS GAME","Andrew Roncin","This paper uses Tyler’s rationale as a framework for analyzing the teaching objectives surrounding the design of a video game to teach Canadian engineering ethics.The two keys challenges in this area are defining what should be taught in engineering ethics and then how it is evaluated in order to demonstrate improved understanding. Traditionally, engineering ethics courses are taught as either codes of conduct, or based on case studies with very constrained courses. The evaluation that follows then uses the Defining Issues Test (DIT) or an instructor’s evaluation.However, the above methods could be improved by focusing on engineering ethics as a situated, embedded, and applied discipline. That is, one in which decisions are made as part of a team, embedded in a workplace whose goals will likely be in conflict with the engineers, and whose outcomes are unknown at the time decisions are made.By using a serious game in which the players are protagonists affords us the opportunity to present thick cases with multiple decision points and opportunities for players to demonstrate their ethical bias. Additionally, the progress of players and their interactions with non-playing characters can reveal information on their assumptions and ethical bias."
"Undergraduate Mentors’ Perspectives on Equity-Oriented STEM Outreach","Callum Sutherland; Aida Mohammadi; Jeffrey Harris","This paper explores undergraduate mentors’ perspectives on, and participation in, “Bringing STEM to Life: Work Integrated Learning in Physics” (BSTL), a work-integrated, equity-oriented STEM outreach program administered by the kindergarten to industry (k2i) academy at York University’s Lassonde School of Engineering. To that end, this study brings Feminist Science and Technology Studies and critical pedagogy to bear on a three-phase methodological approach to generating and analyzing qualitative data pertaining to the mentorship component of BSTL. Preliminary findings suggest that (1) undergraduate mentors bring complex STEM motivations, shaped by intersecting marginalized identities, to bear on their mentorship duties; (2) mentors possess nuanced yet occasionally contradictory understandings of STEM, equity, and society; and (3) mentors’ experiences in the BSTL program are variable but positive. These findings suggest that outreach programs can expand their capacity to generate equitable outcomes by actively supporting the creation of STEM counterspaces, foregrounding equity training, and exposing mentors to critical theoretical perspectives on STEM, equity, and society."
"Re-Engineering the Culture: Perspectives of the Feminine-Identifying and Queer Engineering Student","Matthew McDougall; Marie Charbonneau","The inclusion of queer and feminine-identifying students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is an issue which expresses ample discussion, yet little action. Students belonging to these groups face barriers relating to identity of group and self, peer exclusion and intolerance, and trivialization of their work. This paper reviews the literature of 21st century United States and Canada on this topic, expanding into closely related topics, including underrepresentation, cultural cis-heteronormativity, essentialism, and marginalization. It reveals the firsthand experiences of students affected by the cultures of their engineering faculties, as well as their attempts to either persevere through the repression of identity or remain sidelined by their environment. This narrative literature review provides solutions based on research, including EDI curriculum implementation, supportive student clubs, queered survey methods and moderated language. These solutions offer direction for future research efforts and provide methods on scales small or large to improve inclusion in engineering education."

"WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HUMAN FACTORS IN ENGINEERING DESIGN? THE CASE OF THE VOLVO POWERTRAIN","W. P. Neumann; J. Winkel","A case study in Volvo Powertrain is conducted to examine the distribution of responsibility for human factors in the companies&rsquo; engineering design process. Design decisions with human factors impact, and hence system performance implications, are identified in the design of both the product and the production system in a chain of decisions, spread across multiple stakeholder groups. Thus the organisational structure of the engineering design process appears to influence the ability to handle human factors appropriately at each stage of design. Responsibility (although perhaps not accountability) appears to be distributed throughout the engineering design process. Thus human factors aspects require careful coordination throughout engineering design."
"THE ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS - DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM: “TAKE TIME TO DEFINE” WITH CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY","Scott A.C.  Flemming; Clifton R.  Johnston","In previous work [1] it was argued that turning attention from the act of problem solving to the act of problem defining has several benefits for engineering students and practitioners alike. Such benefits include developing and refining student’s empathy and critical thinking skills inside the engineering discipline. The practical question then becomes how to teach and practice the process of defining the problem well. The following paper is a literature review of the current state of problem definition within engineering design research and how problem diagnosis can be taught and practiced by engineers. Two significant insights emerge from this review: (1) traditional engineering design literature does not suggest processes for defining problems; and (2) the authors consider ""Contextual Inquiry"" the most promising tool for problem diagnosis from an Industrial Engineering perspective."
"TEN YEARS OF ENHANCING ENGINEERING EDUCATION WITH CASE STUDIES: INSIGHTS, LESSONS AND RESULTS FROM A DESIGN CHAIR","Steve Lambert; Cheryl Newton; David Effa","Improving student learning and increasing connections between theory and engineering practice captures the main goals of Waterloo Cases in Design Engineering (WCDE). WCDE is a group at the University of Waterloo (Waterloo) that was established in 2005 as a part of the NSERC Chairs in Design Engineering program. WCDE works with instructors, industry and students to bring real life complexities to the classroom by using authentic case studies. Over the last ten years, more than 175 case studies have been developed and implemented in more than 100 courses with over 125 instructors, across all engineering disciplines. WCDE has collaborated with more than 140 industry, government, non-profit, and academic case partners for the development and implementation of case material.Surveys are used to gauge students’ receptivity to case implementations and for continuous improvement. Student feedback from WCDE case implementations are presented and discussed. The benefits and challenges of case study teaching are discussed, along with reflections on the next steps towards extensive use of engineering cases in education."
"EXPLORING STUDENTS’ DEFINITIONS OF SUCCESS: A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE","Max  Ullrich; David S.  Strong","The term “success” has many different meanings for students and stakeholders in the academic environment [1]. The most common measure of student success employed by researchers and institutions is performance-based measures such as grades and graduation rates. The remainder of the definitions are inconsistent among the various stakeholders in the academic environment. Understanding the importance of the criteria used by students to define their success in Canadian undergraduate engineering programs, as well as the degree to which students are motivated to engage in each criterion with a mastery-based approach, could be useful for reconciling the differences between the student group and the other stakeholders in the academic environment and assist in designing teaching strategies that align with these criteria and thus promote a masterybased view of success.
This paper summarizes three achievement motivation frameworks and contributes a synthesis of the literature regarding student and other stakeholder definitions of student success to identify opportunities and methodologies in preparation for a research study on this topic as it applies to success in the context of Canadian undergraduate engineering students.

"CULTIVATING COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE ON A NATIONAL SCALE TO SUPPORT THE SHIFT TO REMOTE EDUCATION","Stephen  Mattucci; Elizabeth  DaMaren; Cori Hanson; Rubaina Khan; Renato Alan Bezerra Rodrigues","Educational innovations and just-in-time supports spread more quickly through social networks thanthrough traditional dissemination avenues. Therefore, in coordinating national level support efforts for the shift to online and remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the principal strategies of theEngineering Collaboration for Online and Remote Education (E-CORE/CIEL) Project was to developnational Communities of Practice (CoPs) to foster connections between instructors. Using an autoethnographic process, this reflective paper aims to synthesize the learnings from the team working to cultivate these CoPs. The analysis of the reflections provides insight on: the needs of the Canadian community of engineering educators during a year of remote education, the perceivedbenefits of engaging in CoPs, considerations for cultivating CoPs in different contexts, andrecommendations for future cross-institutional CoP efforts."
"Understanding Engineers’ Ethical Environmental Responsibility","Emma Jane Randall; David Strong","Engineers Canada states that engineers must, “Hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and the protection of the environment and promote health and safety within the workplace” [1]. This is frequently the only guideline directly related to the environment included in Canadian provincial and territorial Professional Engineering Codes of Ethics (PECoE) which are a primary resource for teaching engineering ethics [1]; notably, Ontario’s PECoE currently does not explicitly mention the environment [2]. Minimal formal ethical guidelines indicate interpretations of engineers’ professional responsibility with respect to the environment may vary in both industry and engineering education. With the growing focus on sustainable development alongside escalating environmental crises, a thorough investigation of engineers’ professional ethical responsibility to the environment is time-sensitive and necessary [3]. The purpose of this study is to improve understanding of how engineers and engineering students view and interpret their professional ethical responsibility to the environment and PECoE in a Canadian context. The ultimate goal of this research will be to aid the development of engineering ethics and sustainability curricula, as well as Professional Engineering Codes of Ethics. A key result from preliminary findings, is that participants feel there may be a need to explicitly include more guidelines on the environment in the Ontario PECoE."
"IMPACT OF INTEGRATING MENTAL WELLNESS AND PERSONAL LEARNING REFLECTIONS INTO FIRST-YEAR UNDERGRADUATE ENGINEERING COURSES","Robyn  Paul; Oluwasemilore  Adeyinka; Melissa  Boyce; Ghada  Eldib; Katie  Gaulin; Kim  Johnston; Lauren  Kelba; Brittany  Lindsay; Rigel  Tormon","Student stress and anxiety in engineering continues to be overwhelming, and students are asking for more support for their mental wellness. At the University of Calgary, we developed and implemented a program to provide first-year students with regular modules and reflection on their mental wellness and personal learning. This work is important to foster resiliency in engineeringstudents. At CEEA 2020, we summarized the pilot year of\ the program [17], and we now have an update on the program implementation as well as preliminary research results. We provide an overview of the importance of this kind of programming, specifically in breaking down theemotional-rational dualism that exists within engineering to support the de-stigmatization of mental health topics. We then provide an overview of the modules presented in this academic year, as well as a high level of summary of the research results from last year’s data."
"A Starting Point for Building Awareness for Indigenous Ways of Knowing in Engineering Leadership, Sustainability, and Design","Nadine Ibrahim; John Donald; Kathryn Atamanchuk; Christine Moresoli","The authors of this paper are non-Indigenous educators who desire to introduce Indigenous Ways of Knowing into the engineering curriculum because they believe it can add value to the impact of engineering in society and positively influence approaches to sustainable engineering design. This is challenging as the authors do not have lived Indigenous experience nor deep foundational knowledge. This paper is a documentation and reflection on the authors’ learning journey and experiences in implementing Indigenous Ways of Knowing in learning resources and activities relating to engineering leadership, sustainability and design. The approach starts with the “work before the work” and describes various ways that Indigenous Knowledge was recognized and acknowledged. Outputs included an online learning resource, and virtual experiential learning workshops. The learning journey has increased our understanding of, and our ability to improve, the positive impact that Indigenous Ways of Knowing can have in the engineering curriculum."
"Sustainable Systems Engineering Course Design: Design for Systems and Society","Robyn Paul; Marjan Eggermont","The new Sustainable Systems Engineering program at the University of Calgary aims to disrupt sustainability education by imbedding a systems approach and regenerative design mindset throughout. This paper provides an overview of a second-year design course, SUSE 301, Design for Systems and Society. The course introduces students to concepts of design for circular economy, regenerative design, and design for justice. Underlying all of these concepts is the idea of transformative learning through a systems thinking approach. Course assignments include chapter studies and discussions, critical reflection through a praxis experiment, and community-engaged design project. Overall, we hope to foster mindsets to develop engineering students who are able to fundamentally shift the discourse on sustainability engineering within industry, and critically reflect on the role of engineering itself. This course aims to provide students with the necessary tools and mindsets to foster real change across engineering industries to better support the interrelated elements of our society and planet."
"TRAINING PROGRAM IN ENGINEERING DESIGN FOR GRADUATE TEACHING ASSITANTS","Flavio Firmani; Michael McWilliam; Peter Wild; Michael McGuire; Nikolai Dechev; Colin Bradley","This program is an initiative of the Chair in Design Engineering of the University of Victoria Faculty of Engineering to an NSERC mandate to improve engineering design instruction. To date, there are not enough qualified personnel to support design projects and help students. This problem will be more evident in the upcoming years when the number of undergraduate students will increase and professors will not have the time to guide all the student teams. Therefore, it is imperative the support of highly qualified personnel specialized in design engineering. To this end, a totally new and unique program that trains graduate students to be “Design Teaching Assistants” (DTAs) has been recently launched. In this training program, graduate students learn about engineering design, teaching and mentoring. The program includes a series of workshops, discussion panels and seminars."
"Work in Progress: A Missing Narrative of Violence in Engineering Education","Christoph Sielmann","Violence is prevalent in many areas of engineering practice. Engineers engage in and support projects that are demonstrably violent against living beings and systems, including future generations of humans. Generally neglected in engineering education in Canada is a nuanced narrative of how violence broadly influences engineering decision making, especially when viewed through topics such as decolonization, equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). This work examines types of violence prevalent in engineering with a particular emphasis on the role of both violence and counter-violence in engineering practice. EDI are reframed using a new inclusive foundation of moral consideration, showing a natural connection, though violence, between principles of decolonization and sustainability. A new, semi-quantitative framework is proposed for incorporating questions of violence into project decision making intended to prompt discussions about the impact and utility of violence in engineering projects."
"A measured educational experience developing creativity with graduate and undergraduate engineering students","Sophie Morinc; Jean-Marc Robert; Liane Gabora","Creative and innovative people are recognized for their contribution to society’s wellbeing. Engineers are often called upon to produce innovative ideas and thus participate in the improvement of their organization’s products, services, and processes. Not aiming at educating specialists with a degree in creativity, we nonetheless believe future engineers could benefit from a deliberate development of their creative abilities. However, building an effective and valid course to develop participants’ creativity is not without challenges.This paper describes an innovative cognitive approach to enhance creativity as well as the pedagogical strategies underlining a creativity course for engineering students. It also presents the pre-post results measured with a revised version of the CEDA (Creative Engineering Design Assessment). We evaluated the creative performance of 59 students before and after a 45-hour creativity course. Quantitative data shows statistically higher numbers after the course than before. Qualitative data provides further evidence of the course’s relevance and effectiveness.We conclude that students’ creativity can be increase and that the course enables a better understanding of creativity and how to foster it."
"ENHANCEMENT OF STUDENT LEARNING THROUGH SELF-REFLECTION","Laura  Soriano; Danny Mann; Marcia R. Friesen","Recent accreditation requirements by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) have forced engineering educators to focus on the outcomes of their teaching efforts. Faculty members are rapidly gaining expertise in the assessment of the 12 graduate attributes, and it is envisioned that emphasis on outcomes-based assessment will improve both the quality of the overall curriculum and individual course instruction. 
Nevertheless, the ultimate goal of any educational activity is to foster student learning. It is anticipated that students will gain a better understanding of the graduate attributes being covered in their courses if they are given the opportunity to self-reflect upon their educational experiences and achievements.
The portfolio is the tool most often used to achieve this goal of self-reflection. A project has been undertaken in the Department of Biosystems Engineering at the University of Manitoba to assess the impact of self-reflection on student learning. During the fall of 2018, a series of voluntary workshops were organized
i) to introduce Biosystems Engineering students to the purpose and art of self-reflection,
ii) to describe self-reflection in the context of the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board graduate attributes,
iii) to introduce the e-portfolio tool,
iv) to develop the skill of self-reflective writing, and
v) to demonstrate the link between e-portfolio development and career success.
The purpose of the paper is to describe the workshop series, the focus groups that followed the workshop series, and the theoretical framework within which the work is positioned.

"Assessing the effect of self-recorded video assignment on students’ critical thinking skills","Min (Mina) Xu; Mariana Barrios","This study explores the impact of self-recorded video assignments and peer feedback on enhancing critical thinking skills in higher education, specifically within a 4th year ""Professional Engineering Ethics and Practice"" course. By requiring students to analyze ethical dilemmas through self-recorded videos and engage in constructive peer feedback, the research aims to deepen students' reflection on ethical issues. Data collected from 27 students across two cohorts included grades from video assignments, peer comments, and student evaluations of their critical thinking skills and learning outcomes. The findings indicate a significant improvement in critical thinking skills, as evidenced by higher scores in the second video assignment compared to the first, and positive student perceptions of the learning experience. The research concludes that incorporating self-recorded video assignments and peer feedback can effectively enhance critical thinking and learning in engineering ethics courses, recommending their continued use in future curricula."
"First Thrive, Then Lead: An Emerging Approach to Engineering Leadership Education","Dimpho Radebe; Kai Zhuang","The study of human psychology has demonstrated that satisfying a set of basic psychological needs - autonomy, relatedness, and compentence - is essential &nbsp;for personal well-being and thriving. However, student mental health data across North America indicates that students are experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression - an indication that they are not thriving. Our experiences of traditional approaches to leadership education, and engineering leadership education by extension, is that it tends to focus largely on the development of competence-based needs, such as specific individual leadership skills and attributes. The lack of focus on satisfying student psychological needs of autonomy and relatedness means that current approaches to engineering leadership education may not be fully supporting and preparing students to thrive, and therefore lead.
Our paper explores the possibilities of incorporating all three basic psychological needs essential to thriving&nbsp;through&nbsp;an expansive, transformational approach to engineering leadership education: First Thrive, Then Lead. Our emerging integrative and holistic approach to the development of engineering leadership education draws inspiration from traditional and non-European wisdoms and practices, as well as our personal lived experiences, and is grounded in well-established scientific theories."
"BUILDING THE ENGINEERING MINDSET: DEVELOPING LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT COMPETENCIES IN THE ENGINEERING CURRICULUM","Marnie Jamieson; John Donald","In this paper we explore building the engineering mindset from the perspective of developing exceptional leadership and management competencies to guide and support the traditional technical competencies that are the primary focus of undergraduate engineering programs.&nbsp; A knowledge base for engineering, science, and design is developed throughout most engineering programs. Math and science are carefully scaffolded from first year engineering to ensure technical competence by graduation. We ask the questions: “How are leadership and management related to engineering work and design?” and “Can we develop a framework to guide the development of leadership and management skills in the engineering curriculum?” We argue leadership and management are integral to the engineering mindset and necessary to address the complex engineering problems society faces.&nbsp; There is discord between the responsibility of the engineer and the decision-making authority for engineering projects.&nbsp; This dissonance often results in engineers being technically accountable for their designs yet lacking the authority to make decisions with respect to the construction, commissioning, and operation of their designs.&nbsp; To address this gap, we suggest leadership and management training be carefully scaffolded in the same manner that technical competence has been stewarded in engineering programs and propose a framework to do so."
"Making writing practices visible and sustainable in the engineering curriculum: a practice architectures theory analysis","Rosalie Goldsmith; Keith Willey","Engineering practice requires engineers who have strong spoken and written communication skills, but the development of these skills, notably writing practices, is often invisible in the engineering curriculum, and rarely embedded. Decades of reviews of engineering education have identified the gap between the engineering curriculum and engineering practice, such as engineering graduates’ level of writing skills being inadequate for the workplace. This paper draws on research from a qualitative study which investigates the perspectives of engineering educators about writing practices in the engineering curriculum, utilizing the theory of practice architectures as a theoretical and methodological lens. Using examples from the case studies, we explore some constraints of the development of writing practices in the engineering curriculum. We then focus on case studies where the development of writing practices is enabled within a subject, across a sequence of subjects and throughout an engineering degree program, and identify elements that contribute to these practices. Our findings suggest that the development of writing practices can be integrated into engineering studies, but certain pre-conditions are required."

"Innovative Assessment Strategies for Measuring Graduate Attribute Competencies","Sabrina Turrin; Katrina Poulin; Amanda Saxe; Roni Khazaka; Marwan Kanaan","Most assessment strategies used in engineering are traditional forms of assessment, such as written reports, assignments, and examinations. However, these traditional forms of assessment are not always the most accurate ways of measuring student learning. In this paper, a narrative literature review is conducted to identify innovative assessment strategies that have been used in other disciplines but are not common in engineering classrooms. Eight such assessment strategies were found, which were then mapped to their potential application in evaluating graduate attribute competencies. This paper can be used as a set of suggestions and ideas for engineering instructors looking to diversify their assessment methods while targeting graduate attributes."
"TRADITIONAL VERSUS OPEN-BOOK EXAMS IN REMOTE COURSE DELIVERY: A NARRATIVE REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE","Anita M.  Parker; Ellen  Watson; Nicole  Dyck; Jason P.  Carey","Assessment is an essential step in the teaching and learning process. Traditional examination methods (closed-book, time-constrained, invigilated, multiplechoice) prevail in higher education despite support foralternative approaches wherein students construct knowledge through active, authentic activities. A review ofthe scholarly literature focused on merits and limitations of traditional closed-book exams in-person and in anonline, remote course delivery context, as well as benefits, concerns, and considerations of transitioning to open-book exams at a time of upsurge in online learning. Within the dichotomy of traditional versus alterative exam strategies, the literature is inconclusive on shared matters, including student academic integrity, study habits, anxiety, performance, and long-term retention of information."
"Meaningful problems in students’ design projects: Relational, perceptual, and moral tensions","Minha R. Ha; Alex Czekanski","An exploratory study on the students’ learning processes in design project settings led to the discovery of important tensions that students experience in their engineering program. Adopting a Critical Discourse Analysis perspective, an we conducted an analysis of dominant images and discourses in engineering student interviews. The results highlighted key conflicting messages about what it means to succeed in engineering education, what engineering means, and who the engineering student is. Certain ideological beliefs posed as serious barriers and threats to mutually respectful and healthy peer relations, resulting work outcomes, and a sense of ‘fit’ or belonging in engineering.Simultaneously, students demonstrated abilities to critique existing narratives and offer alternative meanings. It is this critical, moral agency of our students that amplifies the call for educational reform towards social justice through, and within, engineering."
"STUDENT AND INSTRUCTOR SATISFACTION AND ENGAGEMENT WITH BLENDED LEARNING IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING DESIGN","Marnie  Vegessi Jamieson; John M Shaw","&nbsp;
Abstract – The capstone Chemical Engineering Course
was used to pilot blended learning as part of an ongoing
digital learning initiative at the University of Alberta. A
blended learning course structure was designed,
implemented, evaluated, and redesigned using a
Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB)
Graduate Attribute (GA) based continuous improvement
process over a two-year pilot period. Graduate Attributes
were measured using student self-assessments, instructor
assessments, and through an arms length study on student
engagement and satisfaction conducted with student
cohorts. This contribution focuses on the results of
independent interviews conducted with student cohorts
during the pilot period, instructor interviews, and the data
analysis of the student satisfaction and engagement
surveys. Instructors were satisfied with the increased
interaction with students during class time even with
increased enrollment. Student satisfaction was higher for
students with lower self reported GPAs, and student
engagement improved in the second year of the pilot.
Details of these and other outcomes are presented and
discussed.

"ADVANCED GRAPHICAL COMMUNICATIONS – A COURSE EVOLUTION","James Sykes","After a new course is introduced, its content and structure evolve to a level of relative stability. Part of that evolution is the recognition and redressing of knowledge gaps in the student body. This paper will recount the introduction and evolution of Advanced Graphical Communication (AGC), a senior-level mechanical engineering technical elective introduced in 2016 at the University of Manitoba. Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T) is the core of AGC, supported by the development of drawing creation and drawing checking skillsets. Created at the request of local industry to address a knowledge gap in graduates, industry also partners with the AGC course, placing employees in the class along with undergraduate students. As the course evolved over 4 sessions, assignments were changed or modified, and support materials for various design considerations were developed. Throughout the course evolution, gaps in the students’ foundational knowledge became evident; core knowledge of conventional manufacturing processes and how to select appropriate materials for a design, for example, were absent. The instructor also identified that design esoterica, such as surface finish and fit selection that are critical to a complete design specification, were not addressed in their previous studies. This paper will recount how AGC evolved and how it addressed some of the gaps using instructor-supported focused modules.Beyond this specific course, however, such modules could be expanded to independent micro-courses (IμC, pronounced eye-mu-cee). Specific design knowledge and skillsets will inevitably be missing in an engineering faculty, resulting in lost learning opportunities for students. IμCs are envisioned as engineering design content accessible to the student on demand, allowing discrete learning opportunities to be incorporated as a component in a course or accessed for co-curricular design competitions and capstone projects. These modules would ideally be independent of instructor support and may include physical artifacts that demonstrate specific elements within the module. Whereas conventional teaching pushes the content on the student, IμCs allow pull-based content delivery, fostering students’ ownership of their learning."
"ENGINEERING DESIGN IN THE CREATIVE AGE","Robert V Fleisig; Harry Mahler; Vladimir Mahalec","McMaster University has initiated a new graduate program in engineering practice aimed at educating tomorrow&rsquo;s engineering design leaders. Graduates of engineering schools are well versed in technology and its application but must acquire new skills and competencies in innovation and design in order to become global leaders in their industries. The leading thinkers in engineering design innovate continuously to succeed in the global marketplace. This paper discusses the value and importance of teaching and learning human-centred design thinking for engineering graduates. Achieving significant and continuous innovation through design requires looking beyond current systems design practices. Engineering educators must adapt new ways of thinking, teaching, and learning engineering design from other disciplines. This paper discusses the modes of engineering thinking and how they differ from those of contemporary innovators and examines how a human-centred approach to design can replace approaches that consider human values and ethics as constraints to the design. The authors will discuss current efforts to insert the teaching and learning of a human-centred approach to engineering design at the graduate level in an engineering curriculum. The aim of the curriculum is to introduce students to collaborative, inter-disciplinary, human-centred thinking, with a strong emphasis on generating continuous innovation through creativity."
"ENGINEERING, PATRIARCHY, AND THE PLURIVERSE: WHAT WORLD OF MANY WORLDS DO WE DESIGN? WHAT WORLDS DO WE TEACH?","Stephanie Mutch; Matt Borland; Kate Mercer","This paper presents a brief review of sustainability definitions and analyzes ways of designingtaught in our Engineering education system, specifically acknowledging the capitalist, patriarchal, colonial, Western world that much, if not most, of current Engineering practice situates itself within. Included in these frameworks are pluriversal design, co-design, participatory design, and discursive design. Another important topic that will be examined is the dualist perspective embodied in Engineering practice that creates a distinction between “man” and “nature”.&nbsp; While this problem is inherently systemic, our intention is to provide a partial record of our own critical selfreflection,contextualized using critical theory. It is intended as a starting place for settler-descendent NorthAmerican educators to begin to contextualize our own approaches, not as a way for us to guide steps forward, but instead to begin a self-critique of current approaches that need continued work."
"Decolonizing and Indigenizing Engineering: The Trauma of Learning the Truth about Canada’s Colonial Present & History in Curricula","Jillian Seniuk Cicek; Ella Morris; Jayme Coleman; Clayton Cook; Claire Sagan; Harvey Wastasecoot; Samantha Wilson; Randy Herrmann","Engineering educators in Canada have a responsibility to seek the truth, commit to, and lead reconciliation efforts. This responsibility comes with other responsibilities: to be mindful of the impact that learning these truths have on Indigenous students and Indigenous faculty specifically, and to integrate content and supports to help students and faculty navigate the trauma triggered by these curricula. This SoTL paper discusses the second offering of a course designed to introduce engineering students to decolonizing and Indigenizing engineering. It shares the collective findings from the reflections on the experiences of several Indigenous and non-Indigenous students and one instructor who took the course. Based on our learnings from these reflections, recommendations are made for enhancing the course design to better prepare students for the traumatic impact of learning a decolonized and Indigenized curriculum."

"ENGINEERING INSTRUCTORS AND THEIR TEACHING GOALS, TEACHING PRACTICES AND CONCEPTIONS OF STUDENT LEARNING IN UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","Lisa  Romkey","This paper shares the results of a multiinstitutional study examining the teaching goals andpractices of engineering instructors. Through both a survey and a set of interviews, engineering instructors at four institutions in Ontario were invited to share their key teaching and learning goals, teaching philosophy, and the use of teaching and learning activities in the teaching of undergraduate engineering students. Engineering instructors shared a surprising diversity of teaching goals and practices, and through a discussion of powerful teaching activities, a set of conceptualizations around student learning emerged, ordered in decreasingprominence: Students learn through: (1) making realworld connections; (2) application of concepts; (3) interaction with the instructor; (4) interaction between students; (5) independence and ownership and (6) listening to what the professor says and does. These views are all reflected in the diversity of learning theories available in the literature, and in particular situated learning theory, but an understanding of these specific conceptualizations, articulated by engineering instructors, can be used to better support engineering instructors in their teaching, and in the development of new curricular initiatives in undergraduate engineering education. This work expands on the existing literature on teaching in higher education and teaching practices in engineering."
"What Do Stakeholders Value? Integrating Value Sensitive Design Techniques into an Impacts-Focused Design Course","Jennifer Howcroft; Julie Vale","Value sensitive design is a relatively new design process that emphasizes the inclusion of socio-technical considerations. In this work, value sensitive design techniques were integrated into a second-year design course. Five techniques were incorporated: value identification, stakeholder mapping with a value source analysis, value scenarios, ethnography, and multi-lifespan timelines. A beginning and end of term survey was administered to understand students’ value perceptions. This survey showed a significant (p = 0.00124) increase in students’ self-perceived ability to integrate values in the design process. Through course deliverables, students showed an ability to make connections between values, technologies, and stakeholders, including value alignments and tensions. However, students struggled to find supportive evidence and explain the potential impact of values on the design process. Some techniques like holistic stakeholder identification and value source analysis were effectively integrated into the course while others, like value scenarios and ethnography, were less successful."

"Making EDI Visible: The Power of Identity Theories in Reviewing the Engineering Career Paths Literature","Emily Macdonald-Roach; Cindy Rottmann; Emily Moore","In this paper, we present a literature review exploring the intersections of engineering professional identity, engineering career paths, and equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). In particular, we analyze the engineering career paths literature through the lens of 3 identity theories: role identity theory, social identity theory, and social constructionism. In the end, we found that authors who backgrounded EDI were most likely to highlight traditional roles and individual-level traits as career advancement indicators, whereas authors who explicitly considered EDI acknowledged the impact of social structures and norms on identity formation and career paths. With an understanding that both social and professional identity can impact engineers’ career paths, we argue for the importance of foregrounding EDI in the study of engineering identity and career paths, and recommend future work that deliberately investigates the intersection of these concepts."
"REDESIGNING THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE: ONE PROFESSOR’S EFFO2 RTS TO DEVELOP AN ACTIVE AND ENGAGING FIRST YEAR THERMODYNAMICS COURSE","Jillian Seniuk Cicek; Douglas Ruth; Sandra Ingram","Active learning is a pedagogicalmethodology that research has shown both engages andmotivates students. This paper reports on one professor’swork to infuse active learning into his first yearthermodynamics course. Based on the results of a pilotstudy aimed at exploring the use of active learning in afirst-year thermodynamics course to engage students andimprove their learning, a problem-solving learningapproach was designed for a subsequent offering of thecourse. Mini-lectures were interspersed with tutorials,and active learning and pedagogical tools and strategieswere employed with the intent to increase studentengagement and enhance learning. At the conclusion ofthis course, a student exit survey and a student focusgroup were conducted, and students’ course marks werecompared to their cumulative grade point averages toexamine their course performance. Findings showed thatstudents were engaged by the active learning design andevidence of learning was found. This is the second phaseof a practical action research study to turn a traditional,lecture-based course into an active learning arena forfirst year engineering students at the University ofManitoba."
"Influencing Factors Impacting Women to select Engineering- A Range of Perspectives","Maryam Moridnejad; Wendy Fox-Turnbull; Paul Docherty","To find solutions to complex problems, engineering practice needs to adapt and embrace diverse thinking. The lack of female participation in engineering fields, in the western world including New Zealand, at the tertiary education level (post secondary/high school level e.g., university, polytechnic, etc.) has been a barrier for diversity, equity and innovation in both the industry and academic professions. Non-diverse professions miss out valuable contributions and new ways of approaching problems that a varied workforce brings. New Zealand needs to mitigate the gender bias to ensure a diversity of skills and knowledge in the engineering profession is fostered. This paper presents findings from three studies as part of a larger research project aimed at investigating influencing factors that contribute to female participation in engineering studies at the tertiary level in New Zealand. In the three studies researchers explored student teachers, current polytechnic engineering students and high school students’ perceptions, experiences, and influences related to engineering.
The first study investigated future teachers of children aged 11-13 years perceptions of engineering and engineers. The second study investigated the impacts and influences that led domestic and international female engineering students choose the Civil Engineering programme at Waikato Institute of Technology (Wintec). The third study investigated the impacts and influences that led to Year 12 and 13 students to enrol in a trades engineering related course at Wintec. The three completed studies deployed qualitative research methods using focus group and individual interviews.
The first study found that participants held very strong stereotypical views about who engineers are and described them as: white, male, middle-aged, good at maths and science who may be antisocial, and that they design and build stuff while getting dirty. The second study found that barriers to selection of engineering for women include the school system; lack of career and subject choice guidance available to students at school, lack of promotion of the profession, and society’s perception of engineers as being masculine. The third study found that young women were exposed to strong stereotypical thinking and behaviours throughout their lives that could potentially steer them away from a career in engineering. Other barriers included a lack of timely, accurate career advice, outdated school facilities and inauthentic enactment of curriculum. However, exposure to positive role models and strong support networks, along with developing self-efficacy, assisted them to overcome these barriers enabling them to explore engineering as a potential career pathway.
Given the strong stereotypical views about engineering from future teachers, incorrect perceptions about engineering in society and lack of engineering career and subject choice guidance available to students at school, it is not surprising that there is a shortage of females entering engineering fields in New Zealand.&nbsp;"
"Building Engineering Identity Through Mentorship Vision Boards","Andrea Jonahs; Adama Olumo","Research on science identity, a framework outlining key dimensions that shape one’s sense of being a “science person” and thus persisting in STEM, ensures learning is not only meaningful but attentive to how identity is shaped, especially for those who experience oppression and exclusion in their STEM environments and worlds more broadly. However, few practical and flexible course interventions exist for bolstering science identity in the classroom. In this paper, we report on a novel intervention to build engineering identity in first-year students: The Mentorship Vision Board (MVB). This paper adopts a thematic analysis to identify salient themes in students' written reflections about their MVB. Our results suggest that the MVB nurtures engineering identity by giving students an active role in carving out a material and conceptual space to reflect on who they are, underscoring the value of reflective writing and arts- based pedagogy in technical fields."
"Charting the Course for Gender Equity: Intersectional Insights from Female Graduate Students in Engineering","Najme Kishani; Jason Bazylak; Aimy Bazylak","Background: Despite continuous initiatives to support women in engineering, there is a critical gap in research and practice in engineering graduate studies. Purpose: This study explores the challenges and supports impacting women’s decision to pursue engineering graduate studies. Framework and Methodology: We interviewed female engineering graduate students at a research-based university in Canada. We employed the Gender@Work Framework (GWF) to explore the factors affecting women’s pursuit of graduate degrees. Findings: The findings underscore the complex landscape female graduate students navigate in engineering, encompassing knowledge and awareness, access to resources and opportunities, institutional policies and regulations, and cultural norms and deep structures dimensions. Conclusion: This study offers valuable insights into the various factors influencing participants’ decision to pursue graduate studies in engineering, which varied across their intersectional demographic and education backgrounds. These factors can inform the development and implementation of policies and practices, responsive to the different needs of students."
"USING INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODELING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE HIDDEN CURRICULUM OF ENGINEERING","Robyn  Paul; Laleh  Behjat; Robert  Brennan","Engineering culture perpetuates norms that are unwelcoming to minoritized identities, particularlywomen and racialized folks. A theory useful for understanding this is “hidden curriculum” whichdescribes the assumptions and beliefs that are unintentionally and implicitly taught in engineeringeducation. This paper outlines an initial conceptual model for using IBM (individual-based modeling) to better understand the hidden curriculum of engineering. We provide an overview of the driving question behind the model design, the agents and their attributes, the rules andprocesses which change these attributes, and the scale of the model. This overview of the model building process provides insight into the model design for simulating and better understanding the perpetuation of the hidden curriculum within engineering education."
"Commentary on the design of an alumni survey that investigates the relationships between undergraduate experiences and lifelong learning","Nikita Dawe; Amy Bilton; Lisa Romkey","Lifelong learning is essential for engineering students and practicing engineers but challenging to teach, assess, and measure as a graduate attribute. This paper reports on the development of an alumni survey that measures the long-term impacts of undergraduate curricular experiences for lifelong learning across a diversity of alumni career trajectories to help undergraduate engineering programs learn about their long-term impacts and make strategic improvements. The survey presents a novel method for characterizing alumni career trajectories in terms of career transitions and the relatedness of alumni career activities to their undergraduate programs. Items probe specific dimensions of lifelong learning motivations and strategies and allow for the bivariate analysis of relationships between these variables, career factors, and undergraduate experiences. Combining items into scales proves to be challenging due to the variability in alumni characteristics and experiences. Future research should investigate how engineering students and alumni are motivated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and what implications these tendencies have for their career development and ongoing learning."
"UNLEASHING KNOWLEDGE CREATION AND SHARING IN A REFLECTIVE OPEN EDUCATION","Riadh Habash","The volume of knowledge that engineers are collectively called upon to know is increasing far more rapidly than the capability of engineering curricula to cover it. This reality necessitates rethinking a learner-centered pedagogy by moving from acquisition and possession of knowledge to creation of knowledge, which comes about through reflection, sharing, and interaction in an active learning environment. This paper explores such pedagogy of blended learning that may contribute to the development and mastery of competencies and advance the quality of engineering education. This pedagogy is based on the knowledge creation framework of “acquire-reflect-share-apply” to boost students’ creativity and innovation in two engineering disciplines (Electrical and Mechanical) at the University of Ottawa. Peer evaluation and questionnaire were administered to measure the effectiveness of reflection practice to students’ learning. Presented also are two open educational resources (g9toengineering.com; greenengineers.ca) developed by the author as an online model to enable knowledge sharing and transfer."
"A collaborative autoethnographic analysis of industry-academia collaboration for software engineering education development","Emily Marasco; Ann Barcomb; Gloria Dwomoh; Daniel Eguia; Abbas Jaffary; Garth Johnson; Lance Leonard; Ryan Shupe","As engineering educators seek to prepare students for future careers, it can be challenging to keep course materials current with industry practices and knowledge. Students also often experience a disconnect between their studies and perceived relevance to future industry roles. This study examines the potential impact of an industry-academia collaboration on the development and improvement of software engineering education while addressing these issues. A collaborative autoethnographic approach is used to concurrently analyze the experiences of both industry and academic participants in the collaboration. Common themes across the collected personal reflections show that varied benefits were experienced by all stakeholders while contributing to an improved student experience."
"ENGINEERING EDUCATION IN CANADA IN THE WAKE OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC","A.  Hosseini; S.  Koohi-Fayegh","In this article, a number of difficulties faced in research, teaching and learning by engineeringinstructors, researchers, students and administrative staff in the universities in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. A few solutions, such as use of a sample online assessment tool, that might aid in better delivery of engineering courses are provided. The effectiveness of such solutions devised for short-term use and their applicability in the longer-term online teachingare discussed. Special focus is given to engineering education due to the special standards of course delivery and assessment required by the Engineers Canada and Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board."
"The Evolution of an Undergraduate Course in Engineering and Social Justice","Mikhail Burke; Peter Weiss; Fawzi Ammache; Saskia van Beers","In recent years, core and elective engineering courses have been developed which address broader social and humanities considerations. The purpose of this Engineering &amp; Social Justice (ESJ) course is to build an understanding of the relationships among engineering (process &amp; outcomes) and the social, cultural, economic and environmental conditions of society. This course (in its sixth year) leverages facilitated group discussions based on materials drawn from readings, videos and case studies to frame various social concepts and how they may influence engineering (education) and vice versa. The course was framed as a humanities-oriented course designed for engineering students to take. Positive feedback previous student included students feeling like they truly had a voice in the classroom and empowered them to be able to structure and communicate their positions at the intersection of social justice. Future iterations of the course could consider more guest lecturers and multiple modalities for course engagement."
"TEACHING CIVIL ENGINEERING DESIGN USING PROJECT-ORIENTED INDUSTRY DRIVEN CAPSTONE COURSES","Waddah Akili","Teaching civil engineering design through senior projects or capstone design courses, with industry involvement and support, has increased in recent years. The general trend toward increasing the design component in engineering curricula is part of an effort to better prepare graduates for engineering practice. While some design projects are still of the &ldquo;made up&rdquo; type carried out by individual students, the vast majority of projects today deal with &ldquo;real-world problems&rdquo; and are usually conducted by student teams. The paper begins first by briefly reviewing the design as a &ldquo;thought&rdquo; process, focusing on several dimensions of &ldquo;design thinking&rdquo; and how &ldquo;design thinking&rdquo; skills are acquired. Second, the paper reports on the development, implementation, and subsequent evaluation of a senior design course at an international university, where practitioners have played a major role in planning and teaching the capstone course. The new, restructured design course, co-taught by practitioners from the Region, has met its declared objectives and exposed students to professional practice. This industry-driven experience has also provided information with regard to curricular content and capabilities of departmental graduates. In a way, the capstone experience reported on in this paper, serves as a microcosm of the four year program. Experiences and outputs from the course can be used to provide guidance and insights into curricular changes, teaching methods, and exposure to civil engineering practice in the Region; and helps in establishing enduring connections with the industrial sector."
"Incorporating Sustainability Principles into the First-Year Engineering Design Curriculum for International Students","Roza Vaez Ghaemi; Victoria Ibrahim; Vladan Prodanovic","Courses focusing on engineering design present an excellent opportunity for the introduction of the concepts of sustainability. The purpose of the proposed work is to enhance students’ understanding of sustainability through a project-based approach. For that purpose we developed a new exploratory project consisting of 3 possible real-world inspired case studies and implemented them in the introductory engineering design course. Results show that nearly all of the participating students generally consider sustainability a key aspect of their education; however, the particularities of student opinions with respect to sustainability outcomes in designs largely vary and seem to depend on the goals and design focus of each program. Our analyses show that the project-based learning course had a moderate to large impact on student competencies including systems thinking, environmental literacy, responsible business and economy, social responsibility, environmental impact measurement, materials choice, design, critical thinking, and communication and teamwork. The particular design project implemented here is an excellent learning tool for first-year engineering students, directing them to include sustainability considerations in their products and systems design. It also creates a space for open discussions about global considerations related to sustainability, together with an opportunity for international students to share their personal experience and previous exposure to sustainability issues."
"An Indigenous Cultural Contextualization of Engineering in First Year at the University of Saskatchewan","Joel Frey; Suzanne Kresta; Lori Bradford; Sean Maw; Stryker Calvez; Darryl Isbister","In Canada, Indigenous Peoples are underrepresented in the engineering profession. In a step towards reconciliation, USask’s Re-Engineered first year program includes a fall-term course that introduces fundamental concepts of an Indigenous Cultural Contextualization of Engineering. The course aims to provide structured discussion about engineers’ responsibilities to the recommendations of the TRC and UNDRIP commitments, the importance of meaningful consultation, and the notable Indigenous traditions of technology and design, while allowing students to learn about Indigenous worldviews and reflect on their own positionality. The course assessments provide opportunities for feedback and adaptation through the competency-based assessment system used in Re-Engineered. The course has now been offered three times since the fall of 2021. The development and refinement of the course and the way in which collected student feedback has been used to guide its general evolution will be discussed with hopes that aspects of the course may be adopted more broadly within the profession."
"Using immersive technology to raise awareness about diversity and inclusion in engineering","Justine Boudreau; Hanan Anis","First- and second-year students at the University of Ottawa take design classes which are implemented as hands-on projects where students work in teams and meet with a client to solve their needs and develop and iterate prototypes. A project involving an EDI training tool to expose implicit biases was run during 3 semesters. The aim of this paper is to understand the impact of the design project on the students’ interpretation of EDI issues and awareness of their own implicit biases. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants to determine student engagement, perception, impact of this project. The outcomes have shown that the project had a real impact on students and their perceptions of EDI issues. Participants demonstrated the effect of exposure and increased awareness of EDI issues which gave them the ability to identify some of their own implicit biases through the project."
"Humanitarian Engineering: Politics and Practice - A new interdisciplinary course on the application of engineering skills to humanitarian challenges","Jenny Peterson; Gabriel Potvin","Background and Purpose: Engineers have an important role to play in the tackling of the world’s complex sustainability and social challenges, solutions to which must, by necessity, involve both technical and social components. As engineers require increasing sociotechnical and interdisciplinary fluency, so too do our curricula need to change. Approach: A new course, Humanitarian Engineering: Politics and Practice, was created in which engineering and arts students work in mixed-discipline teams to propose solutions to real-world humanitarian challenges provided by partnering NGOs. The course introduces engineering design, humanitarian theory, and critical political analysis through interdisciplinary lenses. Outcomes: Survey responses suggest that this course provided a unique and rewarding opportunity for students that helped develop their skills in interdisciplinary collaboration, and shaped the way they think about their professional roles. Conclusions: Given the success of this first offering of the course, it will be offered again, alongside a more deliberate study of learning outcomes of this interdisciplinary approach and its scalability."
"Engineers Embracing Leadership: Making the World a Better Place through Data-driven Decision Making","Cindy Rottmann; Andrea Chan; Jessica Li; MacKenzie Campbell; Dimpho Radebe; Emily Moore","Early studies of engineering leadership in North America suggest widespread resistance to leadership among engineering students and professionals. We explore two integrally linked strategies for overcoming this resistance—one conceptual and one empirical. First, we draw on Giroux’s theory of resistance to reframe the assumption that engineers who have questions about leadership are opposing the notion of engineering as a leadership profession. Second, we investigate the notion of leadership affinity by analyzing 617 open-ended survey responses to the following question: “what inspires you about an engineering profession that embraces leadership?” We conclude with a theoretically informed discussion about the potential impact of leadership affinity on engineers’ professional development and social impact.&nbsp;"
"Analysis of a Bridging Program for Incoming First-Year Students to Transition from Secondary Education to Engineering Education","Prarthona Paul; Chirag Variawa","Bridging programs exist in many institutions to address the challenges incoming students experience. This study aims to identify some of the benefits and challenges of one such program at the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering at the University of Toronto. Developed during the pandemic, this program aims to reduce the step-in height as students transition from secondary to post-secondary. This exploratory research uses a program evaluation framework to analyze this program. Literature review suggests a systems approach is an effective method, as it dissects the program into its fundamental parts and provides insights to the decision-makers of such programs [1]. We gather anecdotes from entities within the program and pair them with the analysis to identify if this program improves the student experience, and to what degree. This study is not an evaluation of the program, but rather a discussion about bridging programs and factors to consider when designing them. Findings from this study inform developers of bridging programs about their effect on the student experience."
"What Makes an Exemplary Engineering Leader? In the Words of Engineers","Jessica J. Li; Cindy Rottmann; Andrea Chan; Dimpho Radebe; MacKenzie Campbell; Emily Moore","Recent research suggests that engineers can be more inclined to identify leadership in the practices of admired colleagues than recognizing themselves as leaders [1-4]. We believe by asking engineers who they view as exemplary engineering leaders, we can sidestep some engineers’ reluctance to adopt leadership as part of their engineering profession to allow us to better understand the qualities of engineers who lead. This work is based on two survey questions that ask engineers 1) to identify exemplary engineering leaders in their lives, and 2) to describe what makes an exemplary engineering leader. While we set out to analyze the 828 open-ended responses through Engineering Leadership Orientations framework [3], our analysis of the responses revealed 3 perspectives engineers take to define exemplary engineering leadership: an individual’s values, attributes and traits, an individual’s skills, abilities, and behaviours, and lastly, an individual’s impact to community, society, or the profession. This works contributes to the developing definition of engineering leadership by providing the perspective of engineering professionals from industry."

Carey","Faculty resistance toward outcomes-based education (OBE) can be sorted into two categories— lack of understanding and lack of resources—and can be addressed by leadership through increased education and communication. With this in mind, the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Alberta has created an online OBE Resource Hub on its faculty intranet, guided by the question, “What kinds of education and communication do faculty require to gain knowledge and acceptance of OBE, and therefore be engaged and motivated in the process?” Artifacts on the ever-growing site include theoretical and practical information in the form of articles, tipsheets, videos, and external links. This article showcases the site, since an initiative of this nature might be of interest to other post-secondary faculties working toward OBE.&nbsp;"
"Survey Results: How Does Lifelong Learning Enable Alumni Careers?","Nikita Dawe; Lisa Romkey; Amy Bilton","This paper presents findings from an engineering alumni survey intended to understand the role of lifelong learning in graduates’ careers. It builds on prior work aiming to clarify how engineering programs should address the important but nebulous CEAB graduate attribute. By contrasting alumni responses to the existing graduate attribute definition, we find opportunities to reconsider and clarify how the lifelong learning attribute is conceptualized.
Survey respondents (n = 279) came from two undergraduate engineering departments at our institution and graduated between 1991 and 2020 (i.e. 1-30 years after graduation). Overall, respondents rated “maintaining competence in the field associated with your undergraduate degree” and “contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field associated with your undergraduate degree” as less important than factors related to developing competency and advancing knowledge in domains outside of their undergraduate degree fields. Learning from others, learning for the purpose of innovating, and learning to develop empathy and emotional intelligence were additional factors that are not inherent in the CEAB definition of lifelong learning. These findings have implications for accreditation and licensure body intentions as well as the content and pedagogy of undergraduate curriculum."

"Design of a Completely New First Year Engineering Program at the University of Saskatchewan","Sean Maw","The rapidly evolving role of the engineering profession in society requires an engineering graduate with a more diverse and robust skill set than ever before. To answer this challenge, the University of Saskatchewan’s College of Engineering has embarked upon a complete redesign of its first year program. This project essentially started from a “blank slate” and posed the question, “If we could design any first year program that we wanted, what would we create?” The outcome of this endeavor is intended to be an extremely effective first year program that excites, engages and inspires students, and that holistically prepares them for the challenges to come in later years. In this paper, we review the broad learning objectives of our new first year, and the values that we applied to our decision making during its design.The overall project consists of three distinct phases: determination of required first year graduate attributes, development of program structure and delivery methods, and detailed course design. Phase I has been completed. It has left us with a detailed inventory of knowledge, skills, experiences, and attitudes, distributed across 23 content categories, that the College wants students to internalize by the end of their first year of study.We will outline the methods that we used to compile and refine this attribute inventory, including multiple approaches aimed at meaningful stakeholder engagement, surveys of existing first year programs across Canada, and an analysis of gaps and redundancies between the Saskatchewan high school curriculum and our existing first year program. We will also describe the 23 content categories used to organize the graduate attributes of the proposed first year program and how these categories are weighted in relative terms.&nbsp;
We share some of our key learnings from Phase I of the project, including which consultation strategies worked most effectively, why we focused on first year graduate attributes and not content, and key elements that will be emphasized in our new program. We will also briefly describe the process by which we are starting to develop the program structure and delivery methods i.e. Phase II."

"Accelerating Awareness: Hidden Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Learning Outcomes within an Immersive Classroom Activity","Albert Jiang; Jensen Williams; Stephen Mattucci","This work addresses the challenge of meaningfully introducing engineering students to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) principles. Traditionally, tertiary education introduces these concepts through online modules and/or workshops, often ‘down-selling’ them compared to technical courses. This paper proposes a more impactful experiential approach targeting the affective learning domain. In collaboration with the Centre for Student Wellness, instructors designed a lesson integrating EDI principles into an interactive car simulation game. Students form teams and customize their cars based on survey responses, with rewards and penalties reflecting real-world inequalities. For instance, certain car colors or gender characteristics may result in penalties, mirroring observed racism and gender biases in STEM fields. This innovative approach aims to foster critical thinking about the role of personal privilege in decision-making, offering a dynamic learning experience beyond conventional methods."
"ONLINE LEARNING ELEMENT DESIGN – DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION EXPERIENCES","Marnie V. Jamieson; John M. Shaw","The Capstone Design Course instructional team was selected to participate in the digital learning initiative at the University of Alberta. The goals of this initiative are to increase student engagement and promote flexible, independent learning. The objectives of the instructional team were to enhance the interactions between instructors and student design teams in the face of increasing enrolment and to align the course strategically with attributes expected for graduating engineers set out by the University of Alberta and elaborated in the Canadian Engineering AccreditationBoard (CEAB) Guidelines. Existing course lecture materials were redeveloped into an asynchronous online format for individual student engagement. Related inclass team-learning activities were prepared andimplemented. This report focuses on the design of online learning elements connected to in class active learning and project applications and our experiences with them over the course of a two-year pilot project.

"What Makes a Good Assessment? Assessments for Learning","Michael Stachowsky; Andrew J B Milne","We present in this paper a ‘how-to’ frameworkfor designing motivating assessments, based upon thecognitive theories of expectancy-value and of aligned andauthentic objectives. The framework recasts thesecognitive theories into more practical steps of determiningobjectives, setting expectations, and framing theassessment to be well scoped, authentic, and relatable. Inthe Fall 2017 offering of our Introduction to MechanicalEngineering course, two new short design challenges andone long design challenge were piloted after beingdesigned according to the objectives-expectations-framingframework. In each case, the assessments were designed tobe (to varying extents) engaging/authentic (something thatstudents would want to do), and doable/relatable(something the students could do). The term long project(of largest scope, authenticity, and relatability) was foundby student survey to be the most motivating. Of the twosmaller projects, the second, while seemingly moreauthentic and relatable, was found to be less motivating.We understand this to be due to the context of thisassessment coming during a time in the term when studentwere busy with the term design project and other courses."
"Becoming Aware of Engineering Culture: Toward Sculpting a New Way of Acting, Being, and Thinking in the World","Scott A.C. Flemming; Clifton R. Johnston; Sandra MacAulay Thompson","In this paper the problem of “engineering culture” is explored through the lens of Cultural Anthropology. A literature review of papers which have examined engineering culture in various university environments was conducted and preliminary conclusions drawn. Anthropologists define culture as how groups and individuals respond to dominant images. Of the various images in the literature, the image of the engineer as “problem solver” is most helpful in diagnosing the issues with engineering culture – a culture that has been found to lack in promoting self awareness, political awareness, understanding perspectives of others, and hearing marginal voices. A proposed new image of the engineer as a “problem solver and problem definer” helps move engineering educators toward the practice of teaching problem definition in core technical courses so that a new culture can be sculpted; one that encourages political and self awareness, understanding others’ perspectives, and the ability to listen to traditionally marginalized voices."
"CASE STUDY OF ONLINE DISCUSSION BOARD USE IN AN ENGINEERING EDUCATION GRADUATE COURSE","Alexandra  Davidson; Lisa  Romkey; Allison  Van Beek","Due to the increasing prevalence of asynchronous learning platforms, the development and implementation of online discussion boards have become important considerations in the design of post-secondary learning environments. This research is conducted as a case study of the online discussion board use in a small engineering education graduate course, consisting of in-class and online discussion components. By varying the structure of the online discussion board to allow different types of student interaction, the study identifies trends in discussion board use, specifically pertaining to student participation, student collaboration, and the integration between in-class and online discussions. As a result, the study provides insight into the utility and limitations of online discussion boards in post-secondary courses.

Foster; Patricia Kristine Sheridan","This paper presents a 60-90 minute reverse engineering activity that has been used in a variety of contexts to connect design and leadership education and to demonstrate the need for leadership education in effective design work. This activity elicits participant values by having them identify the key design decisions embodied in familiar artefacts, that have been sourced from multiple suppliers who themselves have distinct and recognizable values. Anecdotal observations and trends between sessions of this activity held in different contexts are discussed, alongside an activity plan so that others can replicate the activity."
"Working with Indigenous Research Methodologies in the EER Context: Challenges and Opportunities","Reed Forrest; Renato Rodrigues Affonso Alves; Jillian Seniuk Cicek","Amid calls for Indigenization in engineering education and beyond, some Engineering Education Research (EER) scholars are focusing on Indigenizing engineering curricula and Indigenous inclusion in engineering spaces. Less discussed within EER contexts are Indigenous research methodologies, which are research methodologies predicated upon Indigenous paradigms that typically emphasize relationality. This paper aims to act as a resource for EER scholars interested in working with Indigenous research methodologies by providing an account of how one Indigenous research study was conducted. Through a critical reflective process, this paper addresses how methodological decisions were made in the context of a study and how those decisions were at once difficult and rewarding. The findings highlight several points in the qualitative research process where there were tensions between Western and Indigenous worldviews in the research process, including the role of the researcher, underlying research paradigms, and how those tensions were addressed."
"Student and alumni perspectives on paths into and out of biomedical engineering","Krishma Singla; Jessica Wolf; Agnes d'Entremont; Negar Harandi","Biomedical engineering (BME) has one of the highest proportion of women students of any discipline in Canada, and at University of British Columbia (UBC). Anecdotal evidence, based on instructors' interactions with senior students, suggests that women and gender-minority students in UBC’s BME program might leave engineering post-graduation, at higher numbers and for careers in health sciences/medicine. Our aim was to examine reasons for choosing BME, changes in career goals degree and post-graduation career paths of alumni. We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with current/past BME students and identified five themes related to pursuing/continuing in BME: Positive and Negative Family Influences; Safety Net of a BME Degree; Dual Identities as Engineer and Physician; Perceived Need for High Grade Averages as a Barrier; and Social Environment as a Factor in Choosing Disciplines. These themes are interconnected, and a combination of themes is needed to explain why students choose to pursue/continue in BME."
"Exploring Serious Play in the Engineering Classroom to Support the ""Joyification"" of Education and Learning","Tim Maciag","Serious play has the potential to enable creative and advanced learning experiences while incorporating enjoyable/fun learning activities. This can be highly relevant in engineering education, where the gravity and responsibility associated with the profession can be daunting for both students and educators. This study explores the integration of serious play in the software engineering classroom. The exploration aimed to transform classroom dynamics and find more effective ways to connect students with the gravity of the engineering discipline while enhancing student satisfaction and understanding during the learning process and adding fun elements. Two distinct serious play activities were designed and evaluated. The first was inspired by Stanford's D.School's Gift Giving Project and the Lego Serious Play activity, while the second drew inspiration from popular board games like Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit. Both serious play activities were evaluated in early-year undergraduate and graduate software engineering classrooms, where qualitative feedback was gathered to measure student perception toward the joyification of their education and learning. This paper describes the designed serious play activities, discusses student evaluation results, and discusses opportunities for continual improvement."
"Economic, cultural, and science capital: Familial factors shaping access to STEM outreach programs for children and youth","Jessica Tran; Katherine Lyon; Kaylin McLeod; Andrew Jamison; Shouka Farrokh; Jessica Wolf; Arjun Swani; Karen Cheung; Jenna Usprech; Agnes d'Entremont","The populations of engineering students and practicing engineers in Canada do not reflect the larger national or provincial populations in socioeconomic status (SES), gender, race, ethnicity, or Indigeneity. Outreach initiatives, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) summer camps inclusive of underrepresented groups, aim to tackle these persistent dynamics of privilege and marginalization. STEM outreach programs continue to grow rapidly in all Canadian provinces and territories and have been shown to increase STEM identity and self-efficacy. However, young people’s likelihood of participating in extracurricular activities is organized by social inequality, particularly socioeconomic status. In collaboration with a STEM outreach program connected to a large Canadian research university, we ask whether family SES is associated with young people’s enrollment in STEM summer camps. Through a survey of campers’ families (n=196), we document household income, parents’ educational and professional backgrounds, home STEM learning environment, and parents’ support for and perceptions of STEM education and careers. Results indicate that many outreach participants come from families with high economic, cultural, and science capital. This research suggests there may be potential for STEM outreach programs to further target groups whose underrepresentation in STEM outreach is connected to SES."
"Improving Classroom Engagement to Maximize Learning in an Interdisciplinary Dual Faculty Capstone Experience at the University of Manitoba","William C.D. DeGagne; Paul E. Labossiere","One of the most effective and efficient ways for an engineering program to facilitate compliance with the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) accreditation criteria is through capstone design projects and courses [2]. Currently, The University of Manitoba Faculty of Engineering has several capstone design courses; however, each is independently focused on its own respective discipline. The resulting educational experience for students, though rigorous and challenging, is maintained within the boundaries of the students’ engineering discipline, thereby neglecting to provide the opportunity for students to work with people from multiple disciplines and across different faculties. This method of education, where students work in isolation, arguably does not reflect real world engineering. Through internal focus group meetings, program representatives from the Faculty of Engineering at The University of Manitoba agree that the capstones should be more reflective of real life situations. Interdisciplinary courses are most important because they “…articulate the difference between educational problems and workplace problems” [1]. Hence, to allow “(students) persons from different disciplines to work collaboratively and are integrated to combine their knowledge to solve a problem” (sic)[4], interdisciplinary capstone courses are essential to a rounded engineering education. Furthermore, teaming with the Faculty of Architecture will provide several benefits for both facilities such as: develop lifelong learning patterns; foster cooperative and collaborative team relationships; and, allow both facilities to learn the other’s cultures and technical languages.Since 2016, The University of Manitoba has presented research papers at the Canadian Engineering and Education Association (CEEA) conferences on the development and future assessment of an interdisciplinary capstone course. These papers have shown the evolution of the course from a multidisciplinary engineering program to an interdisciplinary Engineering and Architectural dual faculty offering. The course was launched in January, 2018, and will be evaluated through the winter session and into the fall.This paper, will explore, define, and explain how the proposed new engineering/architecture interdisciplinary capstone and dual faculty course will be developed, highlight the early stages of its initiation, describe the ongoing implementation, outline how the performance of the new course will be evaluated, delve into how the new course will be improved to make it more meaningful and practical to both faculties and students, and; discover how engagement can improved student learning."
"On the Peculiarities of Design: An Engineering Perspective","Mouhamed Abdulla; Yousef R. Shayan","It is a fact of our existence, that no matter where we are, we most often find ourselves either hearing, seeing, talking, or even engaged in design related activities. Despite this reality, the notion of“design”, and in particular “engineering design”, is often ambiguous, and at times obscure. Thus, the transfer of knowledge of this crucial topic to engineering students engaged in practical hands-on learning or analytical research is usually perplexing to accomplish. In light of this, it becomes worthwhile to dissect and reflect on the abstraction of the design process in engineering. In fact,the aim of this article is to investigate the facets of applied design, and elaborate on its diversity, complexity and elements. Eventually, by concretizing this subject matter, we hope to slightly assist engineering students in alleviating some of the vagueness associated with the principle of design, and enhance their technical skillset during innovative conceptions."
"FAMILIARIZATION: FOSTERING CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING IN ENGINEERING DESIGN EDUCATION","D. J. Caswell; C. R. Johnston; E. Baraniecke; D. Douglas; M. Eggermont","Developing the skills of creative problem solving in undergraduate engineering education is a significant challenge in the typically analytical engineering training program. The problem lies in the fact that the skills of design and creative problem solving are primarily skills of synthesis rather than analysis. Design instructors at the University of Calgary have developed an approach to design that fosters the development of synthesis skills. This paper develops Familiarization as one component of the approach necessary for creative thinking and provides a description of the classroom requirements for developing the concept."
"CDEN DESIGN MODULE DEVELOPMENT: A DEVELOPER'S PERSPECTIVE","Rashaad Sader; Daryl Caswell; Clifton Johnston; Ron Fauvel","In the formative stages of the Canadian Design Engineering Network, module developers are faced with a significant challenge. As developers, we want to create design modules representative of our own best practices, however, the modules we produce need to fit into an organizational structure that is still evolving. In the view of the authors, the fact that the structure is still evolving is a positive one. WE also view the establishment of one submission format prior to the creation of design modules is putting the cart before the horse in a project that relies on creative submissions from many different people with many different approaches to design education.. The purpose of this paper is to integrate a discussion of the current form of the Tier system with a description of the author&rsquo;s module development approach. Hopefully, as more modules are generated, a more flexible pattern for organization and integration will emerge."
"Engagement by Design - 8 lenses for engaging students","Andrew Roncin; Husam Elsaid; Alexander Roncin","This paper provides an overview of Yu-Kai Chou’s Octalysis framework for engaging design through the use of meaning, accomplishment, empowerment, ownership, social influence, scarcity, unpredictability, and loss. These eight lenses form the basis to consider both white hat/black motivators and sources of intrinsic/extrinsic motivation. As Octalysis is a gamification framework used in industry, a brief exploration of how the identified drivers align with psychological research is presented. Finally, to demonstrate the framework, the paper presents a reflective analysis of successes and failures in the delivery of a Project Management course using the Octalysis drivers. By considering the motivating factors contained in the Octalysis framework, instructors can gain insight into how to make their courses more engaging, and personally relevant to students."
"A COMPETENCY-BASED, STUDENT-CENTERED ASSESSMENT MODEL FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN","C. R. Johnston; D. J. Caswell; D. M. Douglas; M. J. Eggermont","The new first-year engineering design and communications course at the University of Calgary has adopted a competency-based, student-centered model for assessing learning. Satisfactory performance in this course requires mastery of core competencies in four categories: ability to function as a member of a team, ability to contribute effectively to product or process design, ability to communicate effectively using the written word, ability to communicate effectively through the medium of drawing. Every assignment in the course is aimed at evaluating one (or more) of the core competencies from these categories. Student work is assessed as Excellent, Good, or Requires Additional Work. Because our focus is on competency, we permit students to redo any of their work to achieve a better assessment. Students must achieve the minimum of a Good on every assignment to have established competency and pass the course. Students can also redo assignments to move from a Good to Excellent assessment. Students compile term work into portfolios. The portfolios illustrate the progression of learning to both instructors and students. Students also use the portfolio to highlight their design and communication abilities to future employers. The new competency-based approach used at the University of Calgary is more effective than traditional assessment models because it requires students to learn from one another and to reflect on their learning. Students receive feedback by following a four-step process: 1) Comparison to posted examples of student work, 2) Discussion with other students, 3) Generation of a written self-assessment, 4) Feedback on self-assessment by instructors. This assessment approach reinforces the skills needed for engineering design."
"ENGINEERS AS LIFE-LONG LEARNERS: PEDAGOGICAL TOOLS FOR ENGINEERING GRADUATE ATTRIBUTE DEVELOPMENT","Shermeen Nizami; Mohamed Abdelazez; Adrian D.C. Chan","We integrate three pedagogical constructs to design a novel toolbox to support engineering graduate attribute development and measurement of life-long learning. These constructs are (i) Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives in the Cognitive Domain, (ii) Curriculum mapping to skill levels of Introduction, Reinforcement, Mastery and Assessment (IRMA), and (iii) High Impact Practices (HIPs). We use the toolbox in a single, but in-depth, experiential education research study in our department’s Biomedical and Electrical Engineering program. We formally introduce these pedagogies to a cohort of eighteen final year students. The students then use the toolbox throughout the term to identify and address their own educational needs such that they develop into independent, competent life-long learners. We test the effectiveness of the toolbox using mixed methods research. Bloom’s Taxonomy levels scored by the instructor and the students had a correlation coefficient of 0.36. IRMA mapping was tested using binomial hypothesis testing. The test accepted the alternative hypothesis H1: Student mapping of course learning outcomes to a skill level was informed by the instructor’s pedagogy and followed the same distribution as the instructor's mapping, i.e., the mapping was not random and p≠0.5. Results showed H1: {I (47%), R (84%), M (63%)}. In addition, experiential impressions of life-long learning on the students were gathered through qualitatively written feedback."
"ENGINEERING ETHICS EDUCATION: MORE THAN A CEAB REQUIREMENT","Cindy Rottmann; Doug Reeve; Robin Sacks; Mike Klassen","The Canadian Engineering AccreditationBoard (CEAB) requires faculties of engineering toincorporate graduate attribute 3.1.10 “ethics and equity”into their curricula. More than the CEAB requirement,engineering educators have an obligation to preparestudents for the ethical dilemmas they will inevitably facein their workplaces and their lives. Our analysis of surveydata collected during a pilot study of our ethical casestudies project examines a gap between students’perceptions about the effectiveness and importance ofengineering ethics education. While there was aconsiderable range in participants’ ratings of theeffectiveness of previous engineering ethics coursework,they consistently placed a high value on the importance ofethics in engineering education. This finding is significantbecause it challenges the prevailing assumption thatengineering students’ disinterest in non-technicaleducation is the primary barrier to effective ethicsinstruction."
"EFFECTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS: IS THERE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE IDEAL, THE ACTUAL, AND THE STUDENTS' PERSPECTIVE?","Nancy  Nelson; Robert  Brennan","The overarching principles of effective educational practice in higher education define the characteristics of an effective learning environment. Institutions of all sizes have demonstrated that it is possible to increase student success and add value to the learners' experiences by applying these principles. This qualitative study explores the alignment between the ideal learning environment, the actual undergraduate engineering experience as defined by engineering educators, and the learners' perspective. 
Building on the benchmarks of effective learning environments, students were asked to complete an online survey based on the Stop, Start, Continue method for acquiring formative feedback. Thematic analysis identified five themes: focus on learning, supported instruction, quality of teaching, student engagement, and other related items including academic rigour and strong relationships between students, instructors, and staff.
Students indicate that their primary learning environment is teacher-directed and lecture-based. This is aligned with the current practices identified by engineering educators, but only partially in line with those of an effective learning environment. Coded items indicate that many students have sub-optimal motivational outlooks, but feel their ability to survive and thrive is improved when they are more involved in their learning and are supported in a more student-centred learning environment. They value instructors who provide clear and accurate resources, and who are supportive through actions both in and out of the classroom. Engineering educators can use these insights to better align their teaching practices with the principles and practices of effective learning.

"TEACHING AND ASSESSING “LIFELONG LEARNING” IN ENGINEERING COMMUNICATION COURSES","Laura Patterson; Carolyn Labun; Jannik Eikenaar","Recent changes to CEAB’s accreditation process have resulted in the need for engineering programs in Canada to find ways to assess critical graduate attributes. While many of the attributes can be measured through traditional methods, others are more subtle and challenging to assess. One that can be particularly challenging both to teach and assess is lifelong learning. As its name suggests, lifelong learning is a process that begins before and continues after a person’s formal education; it is a learner-initiated activity or habit of mind. As such, educators must develop ways to ensure that students understand the importance of learning itself, both during and after their formal engineering studies.Technical Communication courses are excellent vehicles for delivering and reinforcing the skills and competencies associated with lifelong learning. This paper will explore how “Lifelong Learning” as a CEAB graduate attribute can be taught and assessed in communication courses (APSC 176 and APSC 201) housed in an engineering program at UBC’s School of Engineering. This paper will also explore the next steps in developing appropriate metrics for determining the success of these courses in  meeting this element of accreditation."
"Recent Enhancements to the Biosystems Engineering Design Trilogy at the University of Manitoba","Danny D Mann; Kris J Dick; Sandra A Ingram","In previous years, several improvements to the teaching of engineering design were made by staff in the Department of Biosystems Engineering at The University of Manitoba. The first innovation occurred when a trilogy of courses spanning the final three years of the program was introduced as a replacement for a single capstone course in the final year of the program. In its original conception, engineering students were to get three opportunities to be involved in design problems originating from industry, with greater expectations with each subsequent experience. A second innovation occurred when technical communication was formally integrated within the trilogy of design courses. This innovation has helped engineering students realize the value of professional communication skills in collaborating with each other and in preparing reports and presentations for an industry client. A third innovation occurred three years ago when the decision was made to allow students to participate in the prototyping of their designs. The so-called “Design Trilogy” now consists of a single course (Design Trilogy I) taken during the second year of the engineering program (which builds upon the first-year design experience with the requirement of a conceptual solution in response to a design problem provided by industry) and two courses taken during the final year of the program. Students are required to have a design completed on paper by the completion of Design Trilogy II and fabrication of the prototype occurs during Design Trilogy III. The student experience in the Design Trilogy, with particular emphasis on curriculum innovations in Design Trilogy III, will be discussed."
"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DAYS: USING A VIDEO GAME PLATFORM TO TEACH COLLABORATIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT","Chris  Rennick; Derek Rayside; John  Harris; Patrick  Lam","This paper describes the implementation and assessment of a multi-day engineering design activity for Software Engineering students. This activity required students to work in teams of 16 to develop and implement four sub-systems of a digital spaceship. The Unity video game engine with a custom ""spaceship sandbox"" were used to drive student intrinsic motivation for the task, and to limit the complexity of the spaceship implementation. 
Student feedback of the activity was captured through a survey given immediately following the second day of the activity, and through a focus group conducted with four students later in the term. The feedback on the activity was largely positive, with teamwork, collaboration, and the software to accomplish it (Git) as major learning outcomes identified by students. Several improvements are planned for the fall 2019 version of the activity based on both instructor observation and student feedback.

"A Systems Theory Framework for Embedding Lifelong Learning Holistically in Undergraduate Engineering Education","Amanda Saxe; Rehab Mahmoud; Nasim Razavinia","The new educational imperative is to empower students to manage their own learning in a variety of contexts throughout their lifetimes. This is particularly true for fields that rely on fast-changing technology, like engineering. As such, lifelong learning is gaining increased recognition. This paper describes a holistic framework for addressing lifelong learning in undergraduate engineering programs. The authors draw on existing literature to support this novel framework which consists of: 1) course design that intentionally aligns lifelong learning outcomes, teaching strategies, and assessment methods, 2) experiential learning opportunities that scaffold students’ development of lifelong learning in authentic and relevant ways, 3) instructor commitment to their own lifelong learning, and 4) conceptualization of lifelong learning as an overarching graduate attribute that can be incorporated alongside the others."
"Development of a Digital Literacy Course to Minimize Digital Inequities Among First-Year Engineering Students","Khawla Shnaikat; Emily Marasco; Ann Barcomb","This study addresses the challenge of digital inequities among first-year engineering students by employing the Learning Engineering (LE) process to design a set of online modules. Recognizing the critical need for digital literacy in today's engineering education, the study innovates by using a comprehensive LE framework to develop and enhance digital literacy skills. Identification of essential competencies and student personas guided the development of digital literacy module content. By integrating the LE process, the research aims to systemically address digital literacy gaps through customized learning modules. Initial results from the course implementation indicates improvement in students' digital literacy knowledge, showcasing the effectiveness of the LE process and rubric-guided module development. This study emphasizes the significance of digital literacy for engineering students while demonstrating a scalable pilot for enhancing digital skills within higher education."
"PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF THE INTEGRATION OF ENGINEERING IN TO K-12 EDUCATION","Mary Spencer; David S. Strong","There has been a general decline in the number of students applying for engineering programs among Western nation&rsquo;s universities over the last decade. For this society to continue advancing, particularly with the growing emphasis on sustainable practices, it is necessary to reverse this trend and grow the number of students who choose engineering as a profession. It is generally accepted that kindergarten through high school (K-12) education has significant influence on a student&rsquo;s choice of university programs. It is proposed that initiatives be developed to foster interest in the profession of engineering long before students make post-secondary education choices. Potential mechanisms to fulfill this need could include direct student curricular programs, development for teachers, and outreach opportunities for students. As a first step, this paper discusses an initial investigation into current K-12 approaches to increasing awareness of and interest in engineering, as well as the effectiveness of the approaches."
"DEVELOPING HOLISTIC ENGINEERING COMPETENCIES IN A BIO-INSPIRED DESIGN COURSE","Marjan Eggermont; Robyn  Paul","Bio-inspired design can be found in an increasing number of products and applications from surgical staples inspired by porcupines to bacteria inhibiting foil inspired by sharks. As a methodology, bio-inspired design studies nature, its models, systems, and processes and then imitates or takes creative inspiration from them to solve human problems often sustainably. Bio-inspired design as a methodology is applicable to multiple disciplines and has driven innovations in fields ranging from business to engineering. The increase in interest in this method of design comes directly from our search for sustainable solutions to solving problems. A recent technical elective explores this design methodology to increase a holistic view of design using project-based learning in a community context."
"Approaches to Ethically Studying Indigenous Engineering Student Mental Health","Rebecca Balakrishnan; Jillian Seniuk Cicek; Randy Herrmann","Background: As Canadian engineering programs attract more Indigenous students, it is important we understand the mental health needs and experiences of Indigenous students so we can provide the support they need. The purpose of this paper is to share the approach to designing a study exploring Indigenous engineering student mental health and to highlight the considerations required when doing research in collaboration with Indigenous peoples. This paper explores the use of Indigenous methodologies, Two-Eyed Seeing, and the medicine wheel in the study design. Preparing to do research with Indigenous students, particularly as researchers with European ancestry, requires significant planning and reflection. Key features of this include taking First Nation Principles of Ownership Control Access and Possession (OCAP) training and committing to the OCAP principles, using reflexivity as a researcher, and ensuring participant safety when exploring sensitive topics. As we advance truth and reconciliation in academia, it is crucial that we do so with reflexivity, respect, and reciprocity, prioritizing anti-oppressive practices and balancing Indigenous ways of knowing with western knowledge."
"Lessons Learned From Teaching System Thinking To Engineering Students","Amin Azad; Emily Moore","There are frequent calls for engineers to build integrated approaches to complex social and environmental problems. However, engineering education provides little opportunity to explore these ""wicked problems"".
Given the complexity of the challenges, engineers face upon graduation, introducing students to systems thinking approaches and wicked problems could greatly benefit their ability to deal with complex challenges in the real world. At the University of Toronto, we have been taking part in the initiative to design a course with the primary topic of Systems Thinking targeted towards upper-year students from all disciplines. The objective of this course is not for student teams to get to a solution, but more so to develop an understanding of the wicked problem they are working on while educating them to leverage system thinking tools for visualizing their problem space and system mapping techniques to look at open systems.&nbsp;
This presentation will share our observations of the interactions, lessons learned, and challenges we faced during our first iteration of this course. The objective of this paper is to start an ongoing thread about the progress of teaching systems thinking concepts to engineering students throughout the upcoming years, along with the learning outcomes established from this course. In the future, we want to extract the data gathered from this course and research systems thinking principles and their benefits in approaching wicked problems."
"Lessons Learned from Using Competency Based Assessment (CBA) in a First Year Engineering Statics Course","Sean  Maw; Shaobo  Huang; Duncan  Cree; Glyn  Kennell; Wendy  James","During the Fall term of 2020, the first year Statics course in the College of Engineering at theUniversity of Saskatchewan was taught remotely, and synchronously, using a competency-based assessment (CBA) implementation. CBA is commonly used in other professions, especially medical education and teacher education, but it has yet to see widespread use in engineering education.CBA can involve a number of key differences from conventional assessment practices. In this pilot, it involved the following key differences. Whereas previous versions of the course had involved assignments, labs, a midterm, and a final exam, each worth a certain weight in the overallcourse grade, the 2020 CBA version was broken into three modules, each with a “module test”. The module tests were superficially similar to a midterm, and there was no cumulative final exam. Open book assignments, quizzes, labs, and module tests consisted of questions and exercises that addressed a variety of learning outcomes (LOs) within the modules. The LOs were assigned weights in the overall course grade, as opposed to assigning weights to assessments themselves as in a conventional assessment system. Students could therefore overcome poor performances in early assessments of LOs, as better later results on the same LOs would replace the earlier results.A key feature of this approach was that students had at least two and typically three or more opportunities to exhibit competence with respect to the course’s LOs. Another key aspect of this CBA implementation was the division of course material into three levels or “types”. Type A materials were the most basic building blocks of the course i.e. basic definitions, calculations, and concepts. Type B materials were basic integrative problems e.g. solving a basic 2D or 3D particle or rigid body equilibrium question, or solving a basic truss. Type C materials were advanced or “tricky” integrative problems that probed deeper understanding and required more adaptive problem solving. Students were required to meet competency thresholds for Type A and B materials i.e. theyneeded to exhibit a minimal level of competency in the LOs in order to pass the course.Overall, the class excelled in this assessment format and anecdotal evidence suggests that the students enjoyed it. A summary description of the complete system will be presented in this paper, including how grades were determined, how assessments were conducted and evaluated, how LOs were determined, and how the three levels of material were arranged. As well, basic statisticalresults from the class’ performance will be presented, along with a number of observations made by the instructors and some anecdotal impressions conveyed to them by students. The observed outcomes will be compared with the CBA literature for related STEM contexts, although the remote learning/COVID context did obscure the causes and origins of some of the observed outcomes. Changes that will be made in next year’s implementation of the course will also be discussed."
"Effects of Course Sequence on Software Programming in First-Year Engineering Open-Ended Projects","Jon Nakane; Carol Jaeger; Pete Ostafichuk","In a large first-year introduction to engineering design course at the University of British Columbia students complete a five-week electromechanical design and build project at the beginning of term 2. An introduction to computing course, core to the program, may be taken either in the prior term or the same term as the introduction to engineering design course. In this paper the effects of completion of the computing course prior to commencing the project on team performance is analyzed. The data shows that the number of students with computing experience has only a modest impact on team performance for deliverables involving the description of the team’s application of the engineering design process such as poster presentations, and that teams with no students with computing experience generally outperform teams with one or two students with computing experience on the technical deliverable of the project. Possible causes for this finding, along with a summary of resources and teaching strategies aimed at supporting all teams in developing programming skills are presented."
"EXPERIENCE OF PARTNERING WITH INDUSTRY TO ENRICH ENGINEERING DESIGN EDUCATION","Heather Herring; Peihua Gu","Involving industry in engineering design education would enhance quality of education and student experience as most design expertise resides in industry that can be accessed through guest lectures and interactions with students; and real, meaningful engineering design projects are needed for our students. Good industrial projects with enthusiastic industrial participation in the design capstone course would provide very valuable opportunity for students to gain meaningful experience and would prepare students better to be design ready engineers upon graduation. However, there are a number of challenges in association with industry participation. This paper reports our experiences in dealing with industry-based design projects as well as associated challenges. It is our experience and belief that these challenges can be successfully addressed if both university and industry treat the partnership from a long term perspective and provide reasonable resources to the partnership."
"DEVELOPMENT OF PEER TEACHING SUPPORTED DESIGN FOR X MODULES FOR SENIOR ENGINEERING DESIGN PROJECTS","Grant McSorley","Abstract – This paper presents initial results from a series of modules introducing Design for X (DfX) concepts to student project teams. DfX methods are recognised as a means to facilitate decision making throughout the design process and directly support the “Design” graduate attribute as defined by the Canandian Enginering Accreditation Board.
In this senior design course, third and fourth year students are integrated into the same project teams, with the aim of promoting peer learning and leadership.&nbsp; Therefore, a flipped classroom approach was applied to the modules, followed by team-based reflection and discussion after which the appropriate DfX methods were to be applied within the projects. In the second semester third year students from each team were required to update the class on how these methods had been implemented in their projects.
Preliminary results show active participation by the fourth year students, with varying levels of application of the tools within the projects. This paper will present specific examples of student led discussion and exercises surrounding DfX topics, as well as a qualitative evaluation of the application of DfX methods by the student teams. Recommendations for future improvement include the development of additional short duration, concrete, formative DfX activities for inclusion in the modules.

"Engineering education: Nurturing a holistic skill set for future success through an introductory course","Anil Kumar Vinayak; Harikrishna Rao Mohan Rao","The choice of post-secondary courses is heavily influenced by individuals' perceptions of their chosen discipline. Freshmen often bring preconceived notions about engineering, impacting their course preferences. Students excelling in Physics and Mathematics typically gravitate towards engineering, believing it provides a competitive advantage. However, beyond technical skills, engineering demands proficiency in soft skills like problem-solving, teamwork, and creativity. This article, authored by teaching assistants of an introductory engineering design and communication course, delves into the holistic aspects of engineering. The course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of engineering by emphasizing critical skills such as project management, communication, teamwork, adaptability, safety, and ethics. Despite the belief that a strong background in physics and mathematics suffices for engineering success, this course stresses the importance of a well-rounded skill set. The authors emphasize the necessity of developing non-technical skills for a successful engineering career, challenging the conventional narrative, and advocating for a more comprehensive approach to engineering education. The authors underscore the importance of students' perspectives on these concepts and provide their recommendations and a call to action to improve the student perception of such courses."
"Development of Outcome-Based Assessment Metric for Engineering Program Accreditation","Hooman Nabovati Khormazard; Paula Ogg; Mouhamed Abdulla; Jon Berge","The Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) requires engineering programs to assess twelve high-level educational graduate attributes. For evidence of teaching and learning of these engineering attributes, we developed a framework founded on pedagogical practices from backwards design, constructive alignment, outcome-based education, and student-centred learning. This quantifiable framework offers a rigorous and tunable approach to systematically aggregate performance results over a specified duration. Alongside evaluation tools to measure graduate attributes, we created a comprehensive common skills rubric to evaluate performance-based learning activities. Overall, the proposed framework offers an accurate and sustainable solution for the assessment of CEAB graduate attributes used for Bachelor of Engineering programs. With high precision, results from this assessment process can shed light on a set of factors that impact students’ performance in achieving outcomes of a particular engineering program. The results can also build a foundation that triggers continual improvement in teaching and learning courses in engineering programs."
"Peer Learning and Leadership in Engineering Design and Professional Practice","Amy Hsiao; Grant McSorley; David Taylor","This work presents an assessment of the development of leadership skills in fourth-year engineering students, who are project leads of teams that comprise of third-year engineering students in a yearlong Engineering Design and Professional Practice course. It is proposed that the success of peer learning is directly related to the growth and change in the project leads, the progress of the followers, and the strength of the leader-follower engagement. As such, this work will compare classroom observations with Leader-MemberExchange (LMX) theory and the concepts of servant leadership and authentic leadership in the context of an engineering workplace. This work will also discuss both the value of the inputs and the measure of the outcomes in this peer mentorship scenario, i.e. starting with the importance of the individual in peer mentorship, through reflection, goal-setting, and self-awareness, to the importance and practice of designated project lead management meetings, to the significance of knowledge transfer in the learning process. The challenges of peer learning at the undergraduate level will also be discussed. In presenting this work, the authors would like to promote knowledge sharing of how peer mentorship and the development of leadership skills have been implemented and assessed effectively in Engineering at other universities. Keywords: peer learning and mentorship, project-based teamwork, authentic and servant leadership, leaderfollower exchange."
"ADDRESSING DIVERSITY AND GENDER ISSUES IN A CORNERSTONE DESIGN COURSE","Sarah R.  Nicholson; W. Patrick  Neumann; Mary F. (Frankie)  Stewart; Filippo A.  Salustri","In the cornerstone engineering design course for Mechanical and Industrial Engineering undergraduates at Ryerson University, students’ design approaches were being negatively affected by gender and other biases. Therefore, the course was modified to encourage students to explore these biases, with an initial emphasis on gender so that they may design with a fuller sense of women’s issues. This novel endeavour aimed to change the course’s culture via awareness, and by connecting equity, diversity, and inclusion to an engineering context. Qualitative analysis of student reports before and after these modifications showed that the intervention led to user groups that more closely matched actual demographics and included a higher number of women, LGBTQ, and elderly Personas than before. Furthermore, the qualitative descriptions showed less of a skewed tendency to attribute positive characteristics to men and negative characteristics to women after the course modifications were implemented. Student surveys indicated that there was a potential cultural shift within the course, and a broadening of student focus to include equity, diversity, and inclusion when undertaking an engineering design project.

"An Extra-Curricular Challenge Co-Developed with Industry: A Learning-Focused Hackathon","Chris Rennick; Vidyasagar Rajendran; Silas Ifeanyi","There are numerous strategies to include industrial perspectives in undergraduate education, however, it is challenging to provide students with high-fidelity industrial experiences in a classroom setting. These industrial perspectives are very valuable to students’ education as the problems faced in the real-world are often multi-disciplinary and ill-structured. This paper describes an extracurricular event co-organized by an automotive manufacturer and a Canadian university that aimed to bring an industrial problem to students in a setting where they could learn and practice their engineering skills. The challenge was a software-driven task with testing done on real hardware in real time. Optional training at the start of the event helped to ease the learning curve and ensured that students were able to achieve some level of success. While the activity ultimately looked similar to a hackathon, the structure of the event, and the lack of competition between teams created a low-stakes learning environment where attendees of all skill levels could thrive. Feedback from students and the industrial partner was positive, with several students commenting on how this event changed their perspective on work in the automotive sector."
"DESIGNING YOUR ENGINEERING CAREER: THE APPLICATION OF THE DESIGN PROCESS TO CAREER DEVELOPMENT","Dr. Sean O' Brien; Carolyn Geddert","&nbsp;Abstract – Students have often reported feeling unprepared for career planning, development and decision-making. The open-ended nature of career development may be analogous to the design space, and may therefore benefit from the application of the engineering design process. This teaching practice report discusses the authors’ experience implementing a seminar in an engineering program, which guides students to apply the engineering design process to their career development. The application of the design process to student career development may improve students’ confidence and success by reframing the problem into a structure that they are already proficient with."
"DESIGN DAYS (RE)BOOT CAMP: INTEGRATING FIRST-YEAR ENGINEERING DESIGN REMOTELY","Jennifer  Howcroft; Igor   Ivkovic; Matt. Borland; Reem  Roufail; Carolyn MacGregor","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, course activities pivoted to online learning in 2020. This necessitated a redesign of Systems Design Engineering’s Design Days from a two-day in-person event at the start of term to three shorter online sessions throughout term to prepare and support students during their first term atuniversity. These sessions featured new activities including, an arcade game developed using block coding;a Rube Goldberg virtual ball toss; and the design of a Wi-Fi access point reflector. All activities were designed using principles of effective online learning including, social presence, familiarization with online learning technology, and engaging activities. The online Design Days (Re)Boot Camp ran successfully during Fall 2020, supporting most intended learning outcomes and achieving high initial participation. Continual improvement will focus on sustaining participation, strengthening connections to design and technical concepts, and retaining strong elements upon the return to in-person learning."
"OUTCOMES AND LESSONS FROM DEPLOYING DIGITAL NOTEBOOKS ACROSS A MULTI-SECTION ENGINEERING DESIGN COURSE  ","John K. Dickinson","The instructor team of large cohort, team- and project-based, first-year engineering design course were faced with a number of common and persistent challenges; effective modelling and scaffolding of the design process; realizing consistent content delivery, marking, and feedback across multiple sections; keeping student teams on track; capturing individual marks related to teamwork; and establishing good design notebook keeping practices. As part of continuing course updates, distributed digital notebooks including worksheets were progressively introduced to support project and team learning activities and individual assessment and feedback. This paper examines the outcomes and lessons learned from the increasingly expanded role these notebooks have taken and their impacts on both instructors and students. In practice, the digital project notebooks have shown themselves to be surprisingly versatile as a platform to 1) deliver course content, 2) enable regular evaluation of individual student participation, contribution, and/or understanding, 3) record and assess team-level progress on the project, and 4) capture and monitor the evolution of team plans and ongoing activities. However, there are some observed costs to the implementation approach taken so far, including potential loss of flexibility, inhibiting teams from taking initiative or learning to manage their own time and effort."
"Pre-Production of a Gamified Experience for Creating New Design Thinking Mindset","Shelir Ebrahimi; Reza Yazdanpanah; Armaghan Taghvaei","In a rapidly changing world, Canadian Universities are preparing students by developing learner-centered experiential learning programs. Most of these programs within Engineering are mainly project-based courses to provide an opportunity for students to practice design-thinking process along with other technical skills. Engineering students are usually competent with the technical aspects of the design-thinking process, but they struggle to grasp the importance of the early steps that focus on understanding the challenge and generating ideas.
A team of educators have come together to create gamified experiences to guide students through idea generation process. This mini-project is part of a larger work that focuses on the design and the development of a multi-component online course to train students in creating new engineering design thinking mindset.
This paper that is a small piece of an on-going effort, focuses on the design and the test run of a gamified experience based on the concept of “what if?” question to help students to generate more ideas.&nbsp;"
"STUDENT-INDUSTRY PROJECT IDENTIFICATION OF FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS THROUGH A SUCCESS STORY","Jean Brousseau; Simon Bélanger; Abderrazak El Ouafi; Jean Rioux; Michael Landry; Frédéric Gauvin; Steve Côté","Design is one of the key elements of any engineering program. According to the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), design is a creative, interactive and often open-ended process subject to constraints, which may be governed to varying degrees by standards or legislations depending upon the discipline. Industry-based projects are excellent opportunities to help engineering students develop design skills. The benefits of such projects can be very valuable for both the students and the industry partner. However, they do not always lead to success. Through the presentation and analysis of a student-industry success story, the favourable conditions of a joint project are presented in this document. As expected, the most significant success conditions are the students' determination and the partner's commitment, both being correlated. In order to work towards a project's success, the university training team has to ensure that the win-win conditions remain present for the duration of the project."

"SHEDDING LIGHT ON CUSTOMER REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS, FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS LISTS – HOW ENGINEERS LEARN THE CORRECT DOCUMENTATION OF REQUIREMENTS","Ilyas Mattmann; Sebastian Gramlich; Hermann Kloberdanz","Engineering students face a confusion of requirements and product properties during task clarifi-cation in product development projects. As requirements are mainly documented in the form of desired product properties, customer needs and expectations may not be sufficiently considered during the development of new and innovative products.This paper presents the results of a systematic litera-ture analysis of existing requirement documentation forms and analyses the documentation process as it is taught to engineering students. Requirements are often documented through a tripartite process of translating customer ex-pectations from the customer requirement specification to the functional specification, while the requirements list provides the base for the product development process. The contents of these documents appear theoretically different, however, they are barely distinguishable from each other in practice.Therefore, the paper provides a new model-based un-derstanding for the documentation of requirements through gradual concretisation of requirements during the product development process, leading gradually from customer needs and expectations to requirements. Engi-neering students must be able to gradually concretise requirements then document desired product properties to avoid early fixation on specific product properties. Un-dergraduate and graduate engineering students should be taught to consider requirements according to the pro-posed approach as it enables prospective engineers al-ready in the early phases of their engineering education to design highly complex technical products. Thus, the model provides a valuable base for formally supported requirements documentation and the systematic determi-nation of product properties"
"INTEGRATING UCD WITHIN AN AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IN AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING","Olga Ormandjieva; Kristina Pitula; Cherifa Mansura","The Canadian Engineering Accreditation Boardhas defined 12 attributes that an institution must demonstrategraduates of its engineering program possess. We are inpursuit of the attribute ""Design” dealing with the students’ability to select candidate engineering design solutions fordevelopment, with three indicators relating to how candidatesolutions are selected. Our approach to teaching “Design” isbased on “learning outcomes” rather than “teaching inputs”.In this paper, we describe the learning outcomes of teaching anewly proposed Integrated User Centered Design (UCD)-Agile Process in the context of a one term project coursewherein teams of undergraduate students apply what theyhave learnt about Agile software development and UserInterface (UI) design in the context of a real-world projectwith actual clients.

"Global Engineering Leadership – Design and Implementation of Local and International Service Learning Curriculum for Senior Engineering Students","Elizabeth A. Croft; Paul Winkelman; Alaya Boisvert; Kristin Patten","Engineering students are typically well- prepared with technical knowledge and skills that are prerequisite to solving problems. However, recent changes to the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board recognize that contributions made by engineers to our society also depend upon proficiency in key non- technical areas, including teamwork and leadership capacity, service, and global awareness.  In this paper, we argue that service-learning pedagogy addresses many desired graduate attributes required for accreditation. We then discuss the design and implementation of a new service-learning elective course series aimed at providing students with leadership education and service experiences that address these attributes in both local and global contexts. Finally, we reflect on the short term, qualitative outcomes of the course series that has run in pilot form for the past two years with approximately 20 students per year, and has recently been approved as an ongoing part of the UBC engineering curriculum."
"Monitoring Student Engagement in First Year Engineering","Geraldine Van Gyn; Peter Wild","In a 2006 study to assess student engagement in the first year, engineering students were the least likely to express positive views about that experience and reported low levels of academic engagement. Initiatives to address this situation in engineering were in progress, including the development of two first year courses integrated engineering design with required writing courses. To monitor engagement and satisfaction, and assess the impact of the course interventions, the same research methodology as the 2006 study was used in 2010, 2011, and 2012 following the implementation of these courses. Participants in focus groups discussed questions related to engagement and identified factors that had led to their satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Themes identified for the three different time periods were compared to each other and to those that emerged in the original 2006 study. Significant among the themes was the experience in the design/communications courses. Themes of dissatisfaction and alienation were highly consistent with the 2006 study but became moderated. This process reinforced the need for authentic engineering course experiences in the first year and is consistent with previous research."
"Experiential Learning for First Year Engineering through Outreach with a Local Community Hospital","Abbey Desjarlais; Robert V. Fleisig","The lecture is the staple of university learning. It can be effective in the teaching of fundamental engineering subjects such as calculus and physics. However, it offers little in bringing students to understand the role of the engineering profession and its practice. With limited budgets, time and resources, and large first year classes, creating a poignant learning experience for our students is immensely challenging. Yet the university classroom offers an unparalleled opportunity given its diverse pool of talent, skill, and ambition. With guidance our students have the ability to not only meet our high academic expectations but also make a real difference for people in their local communities. At McMaster University, our entire first year engineering cohort is contributing to their local community through interactions with medical professionals and their clients. With an increased emphasis on design, experiential learning, and community outreach we at McMaster University have developed a unique first year course that involves the design of rehabilitation devices in collaboration with occupational therapists, researchers, industry professionals, and local volunteers. The project provides students with a rich and real-world practice experience as well as benefiting those clients with unique problems. This paper describes the successful collaboration between the Hand Therapy Clinic at Hamilton General Hospital and the Engineering 1 programme at McMaster University. The occupational therapists at the clinic presented 800+ first year engineering students with a challenge: design a dynamic elbow orthosis for the unique problems faced by two of their clients. Volunteers from the local community of occupational therapists, industry professionals, and biomedical researchers worked with the students to help them design, build, and test their designs. The paper highlights the challenges of teaching the large class using experiential learning and outlines the approaches for challenging students with unique problems that demand creativity."
"FOUR WEB TOOLS TO SUPPORT ACADEMIC DESIGN ACTIVITIES","Filippo A. Salustri","In this paper, the author describes four Web-based tools currently being developed to support academic design activities (teaching, collaboration, and research). The author proposes that CDEN should adopt tools such as those described as building blocks for a more vital and active organisation."
"TRAINING TEACHING ASSISTANTS AS COACHES","Alexandros Dimopoulos; Kush Bubbar; Roslyn Gaetz; Peter Wild","Abstract – The role of graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) is becoming more demanding as engineering education places an increased emphasis on teamwork and design. For undergraduate students to excel, GTAs must help them form well-functioning teams and encourage them to operate as self-directed learners. In other words, GTAs should operate more as coaches rather than teachers. Many GTAs, unfortunately, lack the basic competencies of to perform as a coach. In this work, we present a 3-hour workshop designed to address this skills gap. The role of a coach and basic theoretical concepts, as well as a simple tool to elicit self-reflection in students are presented through a series of experiential exercises and discussions. The exercises also give participants an opportunity to practice these newly acquired skills while developing confidence in identifying scenarios where the tool may be applied. This workshop has been executed once with a group of 10 graduate engineering students at the University of Victoria. Survey results have been encouraging, we believe that the participants successfully acquired basic coaching competencies and applied them to their interactions with undergraduate students.

"Empowering engineers to develop socially meaningful solutions using empathetic design","Christine Moresoli; Monika Mikhail","This paper presents a potential approach to expose students to empathy when exploring complex societal problems and moving beyond technology-centred design. Combining empathy with system thinking will enable students to explore user experience and recognize the many contributing factors and the competing needs and tradeoffs in a complex system. A lesson plan, for one hour of class activity, is proposed to apply this approach to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of the learning activity is to analyze the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic from a system and user perspectives, including its purpose, operation and stakeholders. A causal loop diagram tool will be employed to identify elements of the system and how they are connected. It is hoped that the analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic will enable students to integrate system thinking and empathy to define problems holistically."

"INTEGRATING DIVERSITY OF USERS’ HUMAN FACTORS INTO A CORNERSTONE ENGINEERING DESIGN COURSE","Erica  Attard; Michael A.  Greig; W. Patrick  Neumann; Filippo A. Salustri","The instructors of the undergraduate cornerstone design course in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at Ryerson University aim to integrate diversity and inclusion into students’ design education.&nbsp; Our goal is to provide resources that students can use to understand human capabilities and limitations, so their designs are better suited to a wide range of users. The project was broken down in four phases: Phase 1 consisted of scoping deliverables and background research; Phase 2 included courseware development; Phase 3 employed the courseware into the Fall 2019 offering of our cornerstone design course; and Phase 4 reviewed and analysed student’s work to determine the efficacy of the courseware.&nbsp; To initiate this effort, we focused on three Human Factors: vision, hearing, and strength. We created a process whereby students could assess these Factors quantitatively for specific interactions and use the assessments to justify specific functional requirements and constraints of theirown designs."
"STEAM – Arts Integration Frameworks for Transdisciplinarity","Chantal  Rodier; Mohamed  Galaleldin; Justine  Boudreau; Hanan  Anis; Liam  Peyton","Whether for 21st century skills development such as creativity, communication, and collaboration orfor transdisciplinary knowledge creation leading to innovation, the integration of Arts with STEM (Science,Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) fields is gaining popularity in higher education. However, a comprehensive survey of proven methodologies to integrate Arts with STEM disciplines (referred to as STEAM) currently does not exist. This paper presents the preliminary results of asystematized literature review done to characterize the integration of arts with STEM disciplines in higher education. It also uses these findings to analyze the most recent STEAM initiative of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Ottawa. This research finds three main rationales to integrate arts with STEM and presents the frameworks discussed in the literature to do this integration. It also examines how creativity is assessed and developed within STEAM higher education contexts. This research contributes a reference of validated arts integration and creativity frameworks which can be used to setup STEAM projects or evaluate them in relation to proven methodologies. The frameworks presented in this research can be used in classrooms and professional environments."
"Writing and Designing a Book about Design and Designing for Young Designers: People who don’t like to Learn by Reading....and the lessons learned along the way.","Brian Burns","Writing a book for design students based on a range of lessons, maxims and wisdoms that had been accumulated over thirty years in the field seemed like a valid exercise. Unfortunately the task was made initially difficult by the simple realization that designers, who many consider to be visual thinkers, tend not to look to books in their attempts to learn how to design. This realization led, eventually, to the choice of a particular format, though with the added realizations that, while, in the past, we have predominantly looked to traditional formats for the creation of texts, papers and books in Engineering, Design and Science, the developments in our technological capabilities for storing and retrieval of information have, quite recently, changed, perhaps forever, how we choose to access all forms of information. The danger now lies in writing for the sake of recording research activity, and in not writing for effective communication, with due consideration for the implications of the chosen media, the time availability, level of comprehension, and the mode of preferred comprehension of the reader. Tradition is strong in the creation of the written word, but we appear to have passed through what could be described as a ‘tipping point’, which now offers a unique opportunity to encourage and promote more effective modes of communication; more dynamic, interactive, visual, in the appropriate format and location, ‘accurate, brief and clear’, and just when it is needed."
"INSTILLING ENGINEERING STUDENTS WITH SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: TECHNOLOGICAL STEWARDSHIP","Katherina V.  Tarnai-Lokhorst","Stewards of the implementation of technology in society, engineers regularly balance innovative design with their primary mandate: protection of the public interest. As technological stewardship achieves higher priorities within the requirements of engineering education, students must learn to acknowledge their obligation to society by deeply reflecting on the ethical implications of engineering design. Mech410T– Engineering in Society: Technological Stewardship is a new, fully-online course that guides students through a comprehensive assessment of this obligation using case study analyses, small group discussions, and team-based, project-based learning. The module activities consist of assigned readings; video recordings of the topic overview and a series of interviews with key partners within the engineering community, including practitioners, stakeholders and regulators; module quizzes; discussion posts; and a term paper, researched and written as a team.

"Team-forming and its Impact in First Year Engineering","A. Trivett; C. Roy; Y. Sewlani","During the Fall 2014 term at theUniversity of Waterloo, the first-year MechanicalEngineering course was re-designed to implement teambasedlearning. In order to improve student's job searchchances, the method of team-forming was based upon theco-op hiring process. The first two weeks of tutorials weredesigned in a way that mirrored the co-op process andprepared students with resume writing and interviewingskills. This led to a significant increase in the number ofstudents who received interviews, were ranked, and werehired by mid-semester. Attendance at tutorials improved,and timely assignment submission in a parallel coursewas improved. All of these measures indicated greaterlevels of student engagement compared with precedingcohorts."
"INTEGRATING OPEN-ENDED DESIGN IN A SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS BASED ENGINEERING PROGRAM","Paul Winkelman","With curricula based largely on science and mathematics, engineering programs promote the ideal of striving for that one predetermined, correct answer. Design, being open-ended, cannot promote that single, correct answer. Thus, the paradigm of design and that of science and mathematics are not the same, presenting pedagogical challenges. The metaphor of the podium is used to highlight these challenges and suggest ways that engineering curricula might be reconstructed to honour design as well as science and mathematics. Case studies, consisting of interviews and focus groups of prospective and first-year engineering students, as well as high school teachers, provide the data for the research."
"DESIGN-BUILD PROJECT APPROACH IN A FIRST YEAR ENGINEERING DESIGN COURSE","George Platanitis; Remon Pop-Iliev","We found that first-year engineering students often have difficulties to visualize and manipulate three-dimensional objects mentally, especially if the assembly involves multiple parts that need to work together in sequence to produce a required function. Ultimately, this lack of ability leads to poor representation of intended students&rsquo; design concepts in paper sketches, as well as poor or unacceptable detailed designs in CAD. Therefore, it is imperative that students develop their ability to manipulate complex objects in space very early in their academic careers. In this context, this paper focuses on the introduction and implementation of a challenging design-build project in the first-year engineering design course at UOIT intended to provide students with early opportunities to physically realize the spatial relationships and the three dimensional causality of the interaction of moving parts in an assembly."
"BUILDING THE BIG PICTURE: A COMPARISON OF FIRST YEAR DESIGN COURSES IN ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGN","Brian Burns; Ron Britton","For the student entering engineering and associated design degree programs the challenge to master the range of fundamental knowledge skills is considerable in itself. In most disciplines the knowledge base on which student courses are constructed is both changing and growing at an increasing rate. As a result it is now difficult for any student to see how these technical, scientific and mathematical courses fit into the big picture of the discipline they plan to become part of. Their high school experience is limited to general awareness at best, but is largely focused on fundamental sciences. This is obvious in engineering, but is possibly more problematic for a student interested in industrial design, with the same core mathematics and physics requirements, yet often without the appropriate visual and creative courses. Additionally, first year students come from a range of backgrounds, which makes the initial courses relating core material to their chosen professions more difficult to focus. This paper details the work of two introductory first year courses &ndash; An Engineering course from the University of Manitoba is compared and contrasted with a Design Studio Course in the School of Industrial Design at Carleton University. In both courses the range of projects given may at first glance seem quite simple, but each has been designed and developed to build the bridge of understanding between fundamental skills and the profession it leads to. Both courses try to take full advantage of the opportunities the projects present within the limited time available. Success in such courses is usually achieved by ensuring that every project/challenge is not seen as &lsquo;the design of a new something&rsquo;, but that it is couched in an understandable reality. This might be achieved by the design process the students are expected to go through, the context in which the design challenge is set, the history and evolution that brought the project to this particular stage, the significant economic, social and business drivers, and of course the fundamental skills and knowledge base being developed. The aim of this paper is to help identify a pattern that other first year engineering/design courses could adopt or modify, as the challenge of &lsquo;Building the Big Picture&rsquo; become more essential."
"Education As Prototype: On a Combined Architecture-Engineering Design Tutorial","Edmund Nolan; Jennifer Davis","This article uses expert interviews to support the need for architecture-engineering collaborations in undergraduate education and uses teaching practice reflection to evaluate an example of such a collaboration at work. We establish the state of such collaborations in professional practice and use that as context to consider the design of an undergraduate architecture-engineering collaborative tutorial. We find that while the experiential, project-based educational model employed can mimic key aspects of professional practice, there are limitations to what can be delivered in a one-term experience. Key to understanding those limitations and decisions are the two diagrams provided in the article, which visualize the tutorial and the courses it is attached to as interrelated learning environments. We find that such a tutorial—in addition to delivering core content knowledge to students in each discipline—should create an environment in which students can develop key interdisciplinary skills and abilities, especially as regards communication, teamwork and interpersonal relations. We also reflect on the key design decisions behind the current iteration of the tutorial and identify future considerations for both the tutorial and this research project, of which this article is intended to be the initial stage."
